## Review of the last week

### XSRC Platform

https://xsrc.its.sustech.edu.cn/

Not working properly now. Having asked the developers from ITS. They have given instructive advice:

`Use email then.`

itsserver#sustech.edu.cn

### Wiki/Blog Collection

https://github.com/tanjiti/sec_profile

A repo about security profile.

Gonna use information from this list first. All the blog and personal websites would be added soon.

`Project: TG Sec Bot`

The project information and the initial proposal would be posted on GitHub and invite you (if interested).

### Improvement

Working on the security analysis and CVE post. Found several vulnerabilities from ThinkPHP and its plugins.

sqlmap analysis shows it's not vulnerable. Doing some SCA recently.

### Communication

I have emailed several top teams and waiting for their response.

The experience from top teams is really important. Besides, not only for CTF, but also for security developers and engineers.

* Nu1L
* GML-SEC
* AAA
* 雷神众测
* 平安银河实验室

## First Offline Activity

Our first offline competition activity would be held this Saturday.

According to the recently COVID-19, shall the offline activity move to online?

1. If offline: I'm going to order the meeting room 515 Southern Tower, Engineering Department. Welcome to participate.
2. If online: we would have an online meeting for competition and sharing this Saturday, which lasts 4 hours.

The sharing would be given by myself this week. I'd like to talk about the Rust programming language.

If you want to share anything else, it's highly recommended to give a talk this weekend.
