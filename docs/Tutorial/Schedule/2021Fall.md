## Training Timeline

There some major changes to our training timeline.

According to the new goal of **intro and improve**, the lecture time is reduced to 1 hour in order to do more exercise.

The offline training location is changed to **TB2, #205 classroom** because of the complaining about the network condition in Engineering Building.

Training time stays unchanged: every **Saturday 2pm - 6pm**.

2021 Fall training timeline:

14:00 - 15:00 Lecture

15:30 - 18:00 Collaborate exercise

## Attendance

It's highly recommend you to join offline in TB2 #205, but if you have any other arrangement, online attendance is fine.

Any pigeons absence for 3 weeks would be stewed into pigeon soup. Because after 3 weeks of patting fish, you may forget the password of your own kali image.
