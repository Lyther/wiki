# Modern Cryptography and Mathematics

## Introduction

Asymmetric cryptography like RSA, ECC. A mathematic definition about security and attacks to the modern cryptography.

Several cryptography methods are illustrated in this course, while you would learn how to perform cryptography attacks. Remember the key point: do not create a cryptography model without mathematics proof.
