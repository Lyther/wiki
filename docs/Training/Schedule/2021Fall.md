## Training Timeline

There some major changes to our training timeline.

According to the new goal of **intro and improve**, the lecture time is reduced to 1 hour in order to do more exercise.

The offline training location is changed to **Meeting Room 551 Engineering College South Tower** because of the failure to get keys to TB2 (aka, picking locks are illegal).

Training time stays unchanged: every **Saturday 2pm - 6pm**.

2021 Fall training timeline:

14:00 - 15:00 Lecture

15:30 - 18:00 Collaborate exercise

## Attendance

It's highly recommend you to join offline in Meeting Room 551 Engineering College South Tower, but if you have any other arrangement, online attendance is fine.

Any pigeons absence for 3 weeks would be stewed into pigeon soup. Because after 3 weeks of patting fish, you may forget the password of your own kali image.
