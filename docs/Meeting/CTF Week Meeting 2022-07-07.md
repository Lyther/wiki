## Training Schedule

Summer schedule have already finished the first two weeks. From the last week, we have 53 registered members.

The offline training has 19 members in the morning, and 22 members in the afternoon.

Every week I have selected several challenges for learning. If you are interested, finish those challenges from https://compass.ctfd.io/

For this week, I'm designing new materials for the advanced network and web exploiting. Some new challenges would be used.

## CTFd-whale

http://detroit.sustech.edu.cn now has a functional CTFd-whale environment. I'm working on the following works:

* Applying Internet connection for the website.
* Applying HTTPS port.
* Syncing challenge environments with CTFd-whale docker.

The new type of challenge platform would be online in a week.
