2. New Platform GZCTF.
3. New Member Recruitment.
4. CTF from Practice to Principle.
5. National College Student Information Security Contest.

### 0x1. Topic: CTF combined with research

Discuss later after the meeting.

### 0x2. New Platform GZCTF

The migration and backup of most of the original titles have been completed and are being deployed to the new platform. **Discussion item 1: the type of topics migrated and the positioning of the GZCTF platform.**

Positioning of the new platform: used for topic reproduction environment (official environment has ended maintenance) and deployment and distribution of original topics. It can also be used for internal competition activities, competition, and new member recruitment.

Topic migration scope.

1. the official platform has been closed to the reproduction of the topic.
2. Deployment of COMPASS CTF self-assigned questions and CS315 original questions.
3. CTF team for new member recruitment.

The retention of the old account will be discussed this week, whether to retain the original account data or to carry out a new account system. **Discussion Item 2: Account data migration will be conducted.**

1. The old account and score information will not be retained (due to the reorganization and redesign of the score of the questions).
2. If you want to archive your account data, we can do it manually.

### 0x3. New Member Recruitment

A new approach to recruiting new members this semester will be used to address the issue of basic content training taking time away from training for active members. At one time, when we did new member recruitment, we would embark on 2-3 weeks of basic content training, and it would be difficult for advanced-level members to learn anything new during that portion of time.

Therefore, this semester's recruitment will be in the form of catechism/materials + offline advanced training. I will migrate the basic content training online, and invite the whole school to attend a 3-week basic content training and lecture, after which a recruitment/in-school competition will be held to decide on new members.

The number of new members recruited this semester will be about 5.

Basic content training will be posted on a wiki and linked to online archiving platforms (e.g. social accounts or catechism sites), and sections on basic content include.

1. introduction to CTF basic content and future directions.
2. the spirit of network security and how to search for information.
3. how to install and use Linux systems. 3.
4. basic program development using Python.
5. Data forensics and information steganography.
6. Data encoding and cryptographic security.
7. Network attack and defense and website penetration testing.
8. Assembly code basics and reverse engineering.
9. Binary Security Fundamentals.

Additional information on the foundation content is provided in part as follows.

1. Introduction to HTML/CSS/JavaScript basics.
2. PHP code fundamentals.
3. Program debugging using GDB and plug-ins.
4. Docker containers and Kubernetes for container management.

### 0x4. CTF from Practice to Principle

The idea to write the book "CTF: From Practice to Principle" is inspired by my professor [Fengwei, Zhang](https://fengweiz.github.io/). From all of my personal experience with the CTF challenges and the events, there's always a huge gap between the beginner layer *introduction* to the advanced layer *expert*. When I start to step out of the beginner layer, it's very difficult to understand how and why some advanced knowledge.

Under the thought of this aspect of the difficulty, I want to introduce those things you won't know when first solved some challenges. Each chapter of the book would start with some practice knowledge, and end with some *difficult* advanced principles. The whole book would be divided into two parts: basic knowledge that you can learn from simply reading and learning some limited necessary knowledge, and the hard part is that you need to read more about the principle, source code, and the details of the techniques.

Being restricted by my skills, some parts of the book would refer to online websites, technical books, and research papers. I would carefully note the reference when I use them, and if that reference has violated the terms of usage, please contact me and I would delete those parts immediately. Besides, related apologies and compensation would be discussed.



**Example reference format: **

One of the common tools for web directory scanning is `dirbuster`[1]. According to ...

[1] dirbuster: https://www.kali.org/tools/dirbuster/ Kali dirbuster description page, https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/dirbuster GitLab dirbuster source code page



The writing of the book is done by my limited experience and the architecture of knowledge. The mistakes and the errors are not avoidable. If you find any of them, please feel free to contact me, very glad to have your advice. By the way, I would like to send some presents (stickers, T-shirts, or other little things) in return. Luckily, we have an online page to host the book during my writing progress. It's also fine to use GitHub's pull request to correct any mistake.

Enough for the book writing, now let's talk about the structure of the book in the next chapter.

### 0x5. National College Student Information Security Contest

**The National Student Information Security Competition** is a large-scale network security competition recognized by the Ministry of Education and co-organized by the Office of the Leading Group of Network Security and Informatization of the CPC Central Committee, the National Information Security Engineering and Technology Research Center, the China Internet Development Foundation, and the China Information Security Certification Center, which has been held for fifteen years so far, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Institute of Electronic Science and Technology Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Renmin University of China, and Fudan University all conduct special training and participation for this purpose.

The competition will be held in two tracks: the "**Works Competition**" and the "**Innovation and Practice Competition**". I will introduce them separately and use the 15th National Student Information Security Competition as an example to help you schedule.
