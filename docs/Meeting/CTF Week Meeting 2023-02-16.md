### 0x2. CTF-Related Research Components

I will continue to communicate with my colleagues in the COMPASS lab to try to integrate CTF with academic research. Currently, through communication with some CTF players, cryptography is the most closely integrated link between CTF and research. An example of this is the research described below.

Fuzzing is likewise a relatively hot topic in research, and the following information is relevant.
