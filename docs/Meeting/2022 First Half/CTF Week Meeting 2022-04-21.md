The current tools are collected from every CTF challenge.

Some challenges are using some specific tool, that isn't on the list.

I've found the difficulty to configure every machine to work for CTF events. So, let's make a toolkit for fast establishing the environment.

* Docker image
* Kali virtual machine image
* Windows toolkit
* (Not sure) macOS toolkit
