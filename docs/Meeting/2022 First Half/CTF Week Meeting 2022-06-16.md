**Location: **551 Meeting Room, Southern Tower of the Engineering Department & Online

**Topic: **CTF Overview & Fun-oriented challenges.

### What we are going to do

This week, we would register all members who want to participate in our summer schedule. I'm going to share something interesting about the CTFs and InfoSec. It's also a great time to meet some team members.

**In the morning:**

Discuss the schedule plans. Choose your learning goal and find the appropriate level. We would talk about some fun parts in the InfoSec also.

**In the afternoon:**

Learn about the different types of the CTF, and which kind of events you are interested in. Let's work on some teamwork and solve the challenges. Hope you enjoy the travel to InfoSec.

### What you should take

* A fully functional laptop (if you want to bring a desktop, it's also fine). Don't forget to take the charger.
* An earphone. We are going to listen to some audio.

* Your teammate, classmate, and whoever you want to work with.
