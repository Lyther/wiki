## 2nd Guangdong CTF

2 top 50 teams:

| Team name | Rank | Writeups  |
| --------- | ---- | --------- |
| HED       | 9    | Submitted |
| MFGI      | 37   | Submitted |

Removed repetitive teams from the top 36 (3 or more teams of the same university), MFGI's rank is 28.

I'm waiting for the notifications of the final round. However, the organizers are still counting the results (till 15:00 Thursday).

## Summer Schedule

During the summer of 2022, we are going to open another training and recruiting plan.

The summer schedule would be divided into 2 parts: basic rank and advanced rank. The previous one's goal is to teach some necessary knowledge for the interests and would be easier. The last one's goal is to train for the COMPASS team which would be harder.

|                         | Basic               | Advanced                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Estimated time per week | 6 hours             | 15 hours                       |
| Knowledge level         | for interests       | for competitions               |
| Lectures                | Yes                 | Yes                            |
| Weekly challenges       | Optional            | Yes                            |
| Leader for training     | Group discussion    | Assigned team members          |
| Qualification exam      | free to participate | free to participate, +5 points |

The training schedule would last for 2 months, and then we would have a qualification exam. Around the top 20% of members are admitted to the team.

The detailed schedule and the document would be published on a single page (Before the summer vacation).
