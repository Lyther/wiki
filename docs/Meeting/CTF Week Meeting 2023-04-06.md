### 0x3. Skip the Training this week

The meeting started with a discussion about the upcoming mid-term exams, which many members of the group are preparing for. The group acknowledged that these exams are an important priority and require significant preparation time and effort. Several members expressed concern that they could not attend the training sessions over the weekend due to their exam preparation.

After some discussion, it was proposed that the group skip training for the upcoming weekend to allow members to focus on their exams. The group discussed the potential impact of missing one training weekend and weighed the decision's pros and cons. Ultimately, it was decided that the benefits of allowing members to fully focus on their exams outweighed the potential negative impact of missing one weekend of training.

The group agreed that skipping training for the upcoming weekend was the best decision to allow members to focus on their mid-term exams. The decision was made after a thorough discussion and weighing of the potential impact on the group's training goals. The group will continue to monitor the situation and make adjustments as necessary to ensure that they stay on track with their training.
