# CTF Week Meeting 2022-08-11

1. Summer schedule final exam challenges.
1. Upcoming events: Wangding Cup register.
1. Other competitions.

## Summer schedule final

Our summer schedule would be ended in August 14th. The final exam would be held on the Detroit platform.

CTFd-whale has worked properly. In case the Detroit platform has un-predictable problems, we would have a backup location at CTFd as well.

The challenges categories:

| Category | Challenge | Difficulty     |
| -------- | --------- | -------------- |
| Misc     | 3         | Easy to Medium |
| Web      | 4         | Easy to Hard   |
| Crypto   | 3         | Medium         |
| Re       | 3         | Medium to Hard |
| PWN      | 4         | Medium to Hard |

I would update the challenges to a self-hosted CTFd for test. Team members can access this platform to try the challenges.

Challenge time: August 14th 9:00am to 17:00pm.

Challenge solving: please solve by yourself, teaming and cheating are not allowed.

## Wangding Cup

https://www.wangdingcup.com/

Register till August 19th 20:00.

Possible time:

* For university: August 26th.
* For companies: August 31st.

This event is one of the most famous CTF competitions. The size for each team is 4 members, we are going to have 2 or 3 teams.

This event would be easier than the Qiangwang cup. However, it's not easy to get into the final round.

If you are interested in this event, please send me the register information.
