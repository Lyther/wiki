### Exam and the score

The training schedule isn't a course or something you need to rat race to get an A-level score. But, I think taking some grades can be feedback on your learning.

How to join the compass team? Sometimes, joining the CTF competitions can be done by oneself, but usually, we need teamwork to get a better grade in the competitions. You don't want your teammate to be a newbie, right? The exam and the score are used to make sure that every member is great.

Thus, if you find anything that is non-reasonable in our score system, please write an email to me. I would appreciate having your advice.

The scoring system won't have a cap, you can get as many points if you want. However, I don't like the rat race. So, every category would have a percentage in the result.

The final score formula is: `score = weight * sum(percent * log(2, score))`

The categories involves,

- Evaluation of the weekly challenges, and competitions: 30%.
- Remark from the team members: 10%.
- The sharing and the report score: 15%.
- The final exam: 100%.

The weight would be according to your grade. A freshman in the university is less experienced compared with the senior students, but from future learning, a freshman can have more time to improve. The weight is in order to balance the grades.

- Freshman (grade 1): +6%.
- Sophomore (grade 2): +4%.
- Junior (grade 3): +2%.

This is summer training, and we won't have any senior members (they are already graduated).

For example, if you got 3127 in the challenges and competitions, 155 in the remarks, 229 in the report, and 1625 in the final exam. You are a freshman in the university and just finished your first year. The total score would be: `1.06 * (0.3 * 11.610563503925041 + 0.1 * 7.2761244052742375 + 0.15 * 7.839203788096944 + 1 * 10.66622400280318) = 17.016059226486018`.
