# CTF Week Meeting 2022-02-17

1. How to improve my skills/techniques?
2. Wiki/Blog collection.
3. Competitions.

## Improvement

About our mission this semester: self-improvement and advanced skills learning. 

A. material learning and reading.

B. challenge/competition solving.

C. vulnerability dig and website/open-source pen-testing.

D. sharing.

It's highly encouraged to share your blog/wirteups with us. Talking with each other in the group is also a good method to get improved.

Don't be shy.

Don't be afraid to talk with "dalao". In fact, all of us are grown from newbies. And in fact, none of us is satisfied with our current knowledge.

## Collection

I've encountered some difficulties these days. It's hard to find new contents to learn about. I need your help.

The goal of having more collections about the wiki/forum/blog is to fully access the CTF and hacking. We are going to design a book about CTF.

The contributions would help us:

A. design this book.

B. handle a daily sharing bot/wechat channel.

Everything you find may help above can send to me.
