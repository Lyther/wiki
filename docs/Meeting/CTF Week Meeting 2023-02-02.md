### 0x1. Ande Cup (安德杯) CTF game

Just a game.

Inspired by an entertainment contest mentioned in a chat, I am working on the content design and topic design, about 20 questions or so, there will be some simple promotion in QQ group/CTFtime, not a serious cyber security RW vulnerability contest, but entertainment for beginners.

The contest is tentatively scheduled for Feb 26 - Feb 27, 2023, and will last for 24 hours.

### 0x2. Remedial content session

In these tutorials, I will sync the written content to our wiki for use as an introduction to cybersecurity, currently selected content is

* What is cybersecurity and the hacker attitude.
* Installation and basic operation of Linux-based operating systems.
* Simple programming using the Python language, including math, networking, and image processing.
* How to use Sagemath to perform mathematical operations.
* Network packet capture and analysis via Burp Suite or Fiddler.
* Understanding file structure and using a hex editor.
* Reverse executables such as ELF and PE via IDA or Ghidra.
* Basic content and exploitation of binary vulnerabilities.
* Creating containers with Docker and container management with K8S.

This content will be updated gradually in the form of written materials or video images and will not be available in offline training sessions.

### 0x3. 2023 spring training schedule

For the spring 2023 program, we will continue to use the same weekly training format as before, and we will accept your suggestions to add a sharing and combination of questions to the training and add more practical content in addition to theory.

Each week, I will also post an archived replay of a recent competition, or a self-practice session on a selected topic, which you are free to arrange according to your schedule. Of course, if there is a competition planned for the week, the competition topic review will be delayed/reduced/canceled.

#### Spring 2023 Program

In the spring 2023 program, we have two components: recruitment of new members and advanced training. After a semester of competition and training, everyone's cybersecurity level and ability have improved, and I will focus on deepening learning in a certain direction this semester.

I will not recruit too many new members this semester, and the final recruitment will still be conducted through the competition, mainly for the freshmen of 2022, and the number of recruits will be mainly used to make up for the number of members who will graduate after this semester.

The number of recruits will be used to make up for the number of members who will graduate after this semester. The spring 2023 offline training and competition questions will be updated on [this page](../Training/Schedule/2023Spring.md).

### 0x4. Upcoming events.

I have updated the tournament calendar for February and here are the tournaments that will take place this week.
