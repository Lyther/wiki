The 9th Annual University of Science and Technology of China Information Security Competition 2022 is about to open. This competition is held online and lasts up to a week, with a gradient of difficulty in the questions. In the main atmosphere of exploring and solving puzzles, contestants will compete with various levels.

The competition will improve the quality of the questions while also having a step-by-step guide for newcomers, which will hopefully bring a good competition experience to each contestant. We welcome your active participation and wish you satisfactory results!

## Weekly training and sharing plans

According to the previous schedule, the training plan for this weekend is `reverse engineering`.

## ASIS CTF Quals 2022

https://asisctf.com/

The competition starts tomorrow.

### Rules

Each team is only allowed to participate under one name.

There is no restriction on the number of team members.

If you have questions about tasks, ask moderators in Discord chat or email. No points will be deducted for these questions.

If this is the first time you play over, you should know that a flag is a sentence or code that you should find in each level. There is no exact procedure to find them, you have to do several tests and think out of the box to get them. Eventually, you'll understand the dynamics of the CTF and how to quickly solve challenges.

If you are sure your flag is true **(we mean %100 SURE)**, but our system does not accept it, inform us via chat.

Reporting bugs in the contest infrastructure has a reward.

Thou shalt not be a jerk. We are all here to learn something new.

Any attempt to disrupting the contest will result in disqualification.

We have a dynamic scoreboard. That means the more teams solve a challenge, the less point each team gets. The formula is:![Scoring formula](https://asisctf.com/images/formula1k.png)

All flags must be in this form: ASIS{[0-9a-zA-Z_-]+.!?|}, unless the contrary is stated. Flag example: `ASIS{_some_l33t_string_l1k3_7hi5_}`

There would be at least **16** tasks.

You can find the latest news and announcements about this contest on the *[announcements page](https://asisctf.com/announcements)*.

Registration will be open until the end of the game.
