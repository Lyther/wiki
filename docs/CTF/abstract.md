# Abstract

The idea to write the book "CTF: From Practice to Principle" is inspired by my professor [Fengwei, Zhang](https://fengweiz.github.io/). From all of my personal experience with the CTF challenges and the events, there's always a huge gap between the beginner layer *introduction* to the advanced layer *expert*. When I start to step out of the beginner layer, it's very difficult to understand how and why some advanced knowledge.

Under the thought of this aspect of the difficulty, I want to introduce those things you won't know when first solved some challenges. Each chapter of the book would start with some practice knowledge, and end with some *difficult* advanced principles. The whole book would be divided into two parts: basic knowledge that you can learn from simply reading and learning some limited necessary knowledge, and the hard part is that you need to read more about the principle, source code, and the details of the techniques.

Being restricted by my skills, some parts of the book would refer to online websites, technical books, and research papers. I would carefully note the reference when I use them, and if that reference has violated the terms of usage, please contact me and I would delete those parts immediately. Besides, related apologies and compensation would be discussed.

The writing of the book is done by my limited experience and the architecture of knowledge. The mistakes and the errors are not avoidable. If you find any of them, please feel free to contact me, very glad to have your advice. By the way, I would like to send some presents (stickers, T-shirts, or other little things) in return. Luckily, we have an online page to host the book during my writing progress. It's also fine to use GitHub's pull request to correct any mistake.

Enough for the book writing, now let's talk about the structure of the book in the next chapter.
