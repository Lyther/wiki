# Structure

The whole book would be divided into two parts:

* Volume I: basics

* Volume II: advanced

The **basics** part would concentrate on the introduction and beginner layer in the CTF competitions. All the contents of the volume I can be done by reading the responding chapter and very few reference materials. This volume's goal is to teach a quick course about CTF. After reading volume I, you should learn about finishing most of the challenges by yourself, and the skills to improve for the next stage.

The **advanced** part would concentrate on the improved challenges and the guidance to the security area beyond CTF. Each part of volume II needs a lot of reading and practicing. Besides reading the chapter in the book, you also need to finish learning the reference materials and try to figure out the principles of the knowledge. This part is facing those who want to win top prizes in the CTF competitions, and want to grow to be experts in the InfoSec.

During the reading, it's fine to leave the principal part behind temporarily. However, you also should know the difference between the 'hacker' and 'script kid' is the ability to know **why** instead of simply **how**.

Let's talk about the chapter's introduction. If you are majoring in some specific area (for example, Web and Misc), you may skip other chapters that aren't related to your area.

**Volume I:**

Chapter 1: introduction to the CTF

Introduction guidance to the competitions, challenges, and the format of the different CTF events. I will talk about the different styles of the CTF, different areas of the CTF, and some of the key attitudes of the CTF. This chapter won't have any technical details about the CTF, but you will learn about the philosophy of the game and the different goals of the events.

Chapter 2: information gathering

The information quantity is so large that most of the time, you may struggle with searching everywhere and get nothing. From searching for the correct knowledge to solve your current faced problems to the sensitive information gathering for the specific organizations, we want to find useful information out of the ocean of garbage information. Information gathering is the basic skill you should master.

Chapter 3: OSINT and sensitive information exposure
