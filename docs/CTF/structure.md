# Structure

The whole book would be divided into two parts:

* Volume I: basics

* Volume II: advanced

The **basics** part would concentrate on the introduction and beginner layer in the CTF competitions. All the contents of the volume I can be done by reading the responding chapter and very few reference materials. This volume's goal is to teach a quick course about CTF. After reading volume I, you should learn about finishing most of the challenges by yourself, and the skills to improve for the next stage.

The **advanced** part would concentrate on the improved challenges and the guidance to the security area beyond CTF. Each part of volume II needs a lot of reading and practicing. Besides reading the chapter in the book, you also need to finish learning the reference materials and try to figure out the principles of the knowledge. This part is facing those who want to win top prizes in the CTF competitions, and want to grow to be experts in the InfoSec.

During the reading, it's fine to leave the principal part behind temporarily. However, you also should know the difference between the 'hacker' and 'script kid' is the ability to know **why** instead of simply **how**.

Let's talk about the chapter's introduction. If you are majoring in some specific area (for example, Web and Misc), you may skip other chapters that aren't related to your area.

## **Volume I:**

### Chapter 1: introduction to the CTF

Introduction guidance to the competitions, challenges, and the format of the different CTF events. I will talk about the different styles of the CTF, different areas of the CTF, and some of the key attitudes of the CTF. This chapter won't have any technical details about the CTF, but you will learn about the philosophy of the game and the different goals of the events.

### Chapter 2: information gathering

The information quantity is so large that most of the time, you may struggle with searching everywhere and get nothing. From searching for the correct knowledge to solve your current faced problems to the sensitive information gathering for the specific organizations, we want to find useful information out of the ocean of garbage information. Information gathering is the basic skill you should master.

### Chapter 3: OSINT and sensitive information exposure

OSINT is a part of the CTF challenges that majors in gathering information on social media and the Internet. Sometimes, OSINT can have topics about social engineering. Learning about the OSINT would allow you to be familiar with information gathering.

### Chapter 4: Web security

The first major category in the CTF is Web security. Websites are based on computer network protocols and technologies. We would learn about HTTP/HTTPS and other network protocols, and figure out how to exploit web vulnerabilities. The path through this chapter starts with the most famous and dangerous web exploits and ends with the principles and the defense of those vulnerabilities.

### Chapter 5: Penetration testing

Usually, during the modern infosec testing and the discovery of the vulnerabilities. The attacker doesn't have too much information about the target. From the black box to the RCE or database reveal, the procedure to finish a cyber attack is called penetration testing. Let's talk about integrated infosec testing and the attacking.

### Chapter 6: Cryptography

The second major category in the CTF is Cryptography. Mostly, we divide Cryptography into 2 parts: Classic Cryptography and Modern Cryptography. In this chapter, we would talk about some Cryptography types and hash functions. From symmetric Cryptography to asymmetric.

### Chapter 7: Blockchain and smart contract

Blockchain gives a great idea for distribution. In the history of the blockchain, some terrible exploits have happened. The widely used smart contract sometimes isn't safe enough. Learn about how blockchain and smart contracts are working and find out how to exploit them.

### Chapter 8: Programming and Assembly

A hacker who can't program is a script kid. Learning how to write codes and understand the progress of how your codes are executed in the computer. For the different OS, different programming languages are involved. From high-level language to the assembly code and bytecode, eventually to the machine code.

### Chapter 9: Reverse Engineering

Almost all the software we met on the computers is in binary format. From Windows PE to the Linux ELF, programs can be analyzed and broken into parts by reverse engineering. Reverse engineering is also an important part to analyze malware, and figuring out what is going on during the processing of programs.

### Chapter 10: Binary Exploitation, PWN

Sometimes a limited program can be vulnerable, even if the flow control is correct. Almost all the programs rely on some libraries to work properly on the computer. And, sometimes the OS kernel can be vulnerable. The binary exploitation focuses on the lower part of the code execution and finally gains a high-level control.

### Chapter 11: Forensics and miscellaneous

The most complex and wide part of the CTF is called misc. Misc usually contains 2 parts, steganography, and forensics. Steganography is a technique to hide information somewhere. And, Forensics is used to find the hidden attacking trajectory. Misc can have many other aspects, we would talk about them.

### Chapter 12: Automate attacking

Easy and repeated tasks are boring. Several typical examples are telling us to automate some boring parts in the infosec is great. This chapter talks about various automated attempts and different methods to teach tools to be intelligent.

### Chapter 13: Physical security

Physical attacking is the most interesting part of the infosec. Even though this part doesn't have too much chance to appear in the CTFs, it's still an important part of real-world cyberattacks.

### Chapter 14: Attack with defense

Attack with defense (AWD) is another kind of CTF. Jeopardy's goal is to exploit the challenges and find the flag, while AWD is more likely to be in PVP mode. Different from the Jeopardy, AWD needs participants to defend their machines besides attacking others.
