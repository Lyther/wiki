# Velato

Music programming language.

## Abstract

Velato is a programming language, created by [Daniel Temkin](http://danieltemkin.com/) in 2009, which uses MIDI files as source code: the pattern of notes determines commands. Velato offers an unusual challenge to programmer-musicians: to compose a musical piece that, in addition to expressing their aims musically, fills the constraints necessary to compile to a working Velato program. Each song has a secret message: the program it determines when compiled as Velato.
