Combined file forensics.

## Abstract

Foremost is a forensic program to recover lost files based on their headers, footers, and internal data structures.

Foremost can work on image files, such as those generated by dd, Safeback, Encase, etc, or directly on a drive. The headers and footers can be specified by a configuration file or you can use command line switches to specify built-in file types. These built-in types look at the data structures of a given file format allowing for a more reliable and faster recovery.
