# Graphical cryptography

Author: [Japanese] Hiroshi Yuki

## Introduction

This book explains in detail the six most important cryptographic techniques: symmetric ciphers, public key ciphers, one-way hash functions, message authentication codes, digital signatures, and pseudo-random number generators, in the form of diagrams with text.

Part 1 describes the history of cryptography, symmetric ciphers, grouped cipher patterns (including ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, CTR), public keys, and hybrid cryptosystems. Part 2 focuses on authentication aspects, covering one-way hash functions, message authentication codes, digital signatures, certificates, etc. Part 3 talks about keys, random numbers, PGP, SSL/TLS, and real-life applications of cryptography.
