# Code Reveal

Author: Zuo Fei

## Overview

This book is written from the programming point of view, using C/C++ as the descriptive language and Visual C++ as the formal tool, to explain the mechanisms and knowledge about computer composition principles and computer operating systems hidden behind the code, not only to let the reader know the facts, but also to let the reader know the reasons. This knowledge is then applied to programming practice to help readers write high-quality code that is more suitable for machine optimization. Uncovering the little-known secrets behind the code, specifically, the book discusses a variety of topics including the underlying computer coding, memory and pointers, computer instructions and code systems, the mechanism of function calls, multi-level storage systems, the concept of threads and processes, and code optimization.
