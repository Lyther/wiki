The kernel handles all interactions between the CPU and the external world, and determines which programs will share processor time, in what order. It manages limited memory so well that hundreds of processes can share the system efficiently, and expertly organizes data transfers so that the CPU isn't kept waiting any longer than necessary for the relatively slow disks.</p> <p>The third edition of Understanding the Linux Kernel takes you on a guided tour of the most significant data structures, algorithms, and programming tricks used in the kernel. Probing beyond superficial features, the authors offer valuable insights to people who want to know how things really work inside their machine. Important Intel-specific features are discussed. Relevant segments of code are dissected line by line. But the book covers more than just the functioning of the code; it explains the theoretical underpinnings of why Linux does things the way it does.</p> <p>This edition of the book covers Version 2.6, which has seen significant changes to nearly every kernel subsystem, particularly in the areas of memory management and block devices. The book focuses on the following topics:</p> <ul> <li>Memory management, including file buffering, process swapping, and Direct memory Access (DMA)</li> <li>The Virtual Filesystem layer and the Second and Third Extended Filesystems</li> <li>Process creation and scheduling</li> <li>Signals, interrupts, and the essential interfaces to device drivers</li> <li>Timing</li> <li>Synchronization within the kernel</li> <li>Interprocess Communication (IPC)</li> <li>Program execution</li> </ul> <p>Understanding the Linux Kernel will acquaint you with all the inner workings of Linux, but it's more than just an academic exercise. You'll learn what conditions bring out Linux's best performance, and you'll see how it meets the challenge of providing good system response during process scheduling, file access, and memory management in a wide variety of environments.

Inside Windows NT, Second Edition (Microsoft Press, 1998) was written by David Solomon. It updated the original book to cover Windows NT 4.0 and had a greatly increased level of technical depth. Inside Windows 2000, Third Edition (Microsoft Press, 2000) was authored by David Solomon and Mark Russinovich. It added many new topics, such as startup and shutdown, service internals, registry internals, file-system drivers, and networking. It also covered kernel changes in Windows 2000, such as the Windows Driver Model (WDM), Plug and Play, power management, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), encryption, the job object, and Terminal Services. Windows Internals, Fourth Edition was the Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 update and added more content focused on helping IT professionals make use of their knowledge of Windows internals, such as using key tools from Windows Sysinternals and analyzing crash dumps.</p> <p>Windows Internals, Fifth Edition was the update for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. It saw Mark Russinovich move on to a full-time job at Microsoft (where he is now the Azure CTO) and the addition of a new co-author, Alex Ionescu. New content included the image loader, user-mode debugging facility, Advanced Local Procedure Call (ALPC), and Hyper-V. The next release, Windows Internals, Sixth Edition, was fully updated to address the many kernel changes in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, with many new hands-on experiments to reflect changes in the tools as well.</p>"},{"location":"Book/Computer%20and%20System/Windows%20Internals/#seventh-edition-changes","title":"Seventh Edition Changes","text":"<p>Since this series\u2019 last update, Windows has gone through several releases, coming up to Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. Windows 10 itself, being the current going-forward name for Windows, has had several releases since its initial Release-to-Manufacturing, or RTM, each labeled with a 4-digit version number indicating year and month of release, such as Windows 10, version 1703 that was completed in March 2017. The above implies that Windows has gone through at least 6 versions since Windows 7. Starting with Windows 8, Microsoft began a process of OS convergence, which is beneficial from a development perspective as well as for the Windows engineering team itself. Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 had converged kernels, with modern app convergence arriving in Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1. The convergence story was complete with Windows 10, which runs on desktops/laptops, servers, XBOX One, phones (Windows Mobile 10), HoloLens, and various Internet of Things (IoT) devices. With this grand unification completed, the time was right for a new edition of the series, which could now finally catch up with almost half a decade of changes, in what will now be a more stabilized kernel architecture going forward. As such, this latest book covers aspects of Windows from Windows 8 to Windows 10, version 1703.

The graphical tool Wireshark and its command line tool Tshark can analyze such traffic packets. Wireshark is free software (official website is https://www.wireshark.org/) and supports the analysis of multiple protocols and also supports the traffic capture function.</p> <p>The interface of Wireshark is shown in Figure 9-3-1. After loading the traffic packet you can see the network traffic, protocols and status are distinguished by color, click on a traffic to see the details of the traffic. Enter the filter expression in the filter field to filter the traffic and see the required network traffic. If you want to filter network traffic for the FTP protocol, enter the FTP expression to see the results (see Figure 9-3-2).</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Tshark is a command-line tool for Wireshark. Wireshark builds the metadata of traffic packets in memory, so Tshark is useful for analyzing huge traffic packets and can significantly improve performance. Tshark's command-line parameters are very complex, and the details of how to use them can be found at https://www.wireshark.org/ docs/man-pages/tshark.html for details. An example of filtering FTP protocols in the same traffic packets as the previous section is shown in Figure 9-3-3.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"CS315/Lab%201%20Packet%20Sniffing%20and%20Wireshark/#traffic-analysis-common-operations","title":"Traffic analysis common operations","text":"<p>Wireshark's \"Statistics\" menu allows you to view the general status of traffic packets, such as which protocols are included, which IP addresses are involved in the session, and so on. Figure 9-3-4 and Figure 9-3-5 show the protocol hierarchy statistics and session statistics, respectively. These two functions can help us quickly locate the point that needs to be analyzed, because the traffic analysis in CTF often has a lot of interference traffic, and the traffic required by the questioner is usually obtained in the LAN or a specific few hosts, by viewing the traffic information can greatly save the time to find the traffic that needs to be analyzed.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The most widely used transport layer protocol in computer networks is TCP, which is a connection-oriented protocol that allows both transmitting parties to ensure transparent transmission and only care about the data they get. However, in the actual transmission process, TCP traffic can be sliced into many small datagrams due to the MTU, making it inconvenient to analyze. To address this situation, Wireshark provides the ability to trace TCP streams. By selecting a datagram and right-clicking on \"Trace TCP Stream\", you can obtain all the data transmitted by both parties in the TCP session for further analysis, see Figure 9-3-6.</p> <p></p> <p>For common protocols such as HTTP, Wireshark provides an export object function (in the \"File\" menu) that makes it easy to extract information such as files sent during transmission. Figure 9-3-7 shows the export function for HTTP objects.</p> <p></p> <p>Sometimes the traffic packets that need to be analyzed are almost always encrypted traffic for the SSL protocol, and if the SSL key log can be obtained from another location in the topic, then Wireshark can be used to attempt to decrypt the traffic. The Wireshark parsable SSL key log file is shown below.</p> <p></p> <p>After obtaining this form of key log, we can open Wireshark's preferences, select the SSL protocol in the \"Protocol\" option, and then fill in the path to the key file in \"(Pre)-Master-Secret Log Filename\" (see Figure 9-3-8), and then decrypt some of the SSL traffic.</p> <p></p> <p>Due to the complexity of network protocols, there are far more places where data can be hidden than just the normal transmission flow. Therefore, when analyzing network traffic packets, if no breakthrough can be found from the data transmitted in the normal way, then it is necessary to focus on some protocols that look abnormal in the traffic packets and carefully examine the fields to observe whether there is any imprint of hidden data.

Therefore, sometimes binary security is used to refer to both reverse engineering and PWN. the threshold of entry to binary security is relatively high, requiring participants to study and accumulate for a long period of time and have a certain knowledge base before they can get started. This leads many beginners to give up before getting started. To get started in PWN, a certain foundation in reverse engineering is essential, which in turn leads to a further scarcity of PWN participants.</p> <p>The purpose of this chapter is to lead the student to get started, so it will focus on PWN vulnerability exploitation techniques. The part about the basics cannot be introduced in detail due to the limitation of space. If the student does not understand the process of learning, you can spend some time to understand the basics, and then go back to consider how to solve, it may be clear.</p> <p>The core knowledge of binary security consists of four main categories.</p> <p>1. Programming language and compilation principle</p> <p>Usually, the PWN topics in CTF will be written in C/C++ language. In order to write attack scripts, learning a scripting language like Python is also a must. In addition, the possibility of writing PWN questions in languages other than C/C++, such as Java or Lua, cannot be ruled out. Therefore, it is necessary for the participants to have a wide exposure to some mainstream languages. For reverse engineering, how to decompile better and faster is a challenge. Whether it is manual disassembly or writing automated code analysis and vulnerability mining tools, knowledge of compilation principles is very beneficial.</p> <p>2. Assembly Language</p> <p>Assembly language, the core of reverse engineering, is also the first hurdle that PWN beginners have to face. If you get involved in the field of binary, assembly language is not bypassed. Only by understanding how the CPU works from the bottom can you understand why, through program vulnerabilities, an attacker can make the program execute the code set.</p> <p>3. Operating system and computer architecture</p> <p>The operating system, the core software running on the computer, is often the target of attackers PWN. To understand exactly how a program is executed and how it performs a variety of tasks, participants must learn about operating systems and computer architecture. In the CTF, many exploits and techniques also require the use of some features of the operating system to reach. Also, knowledge of operating systems is necessary to reverse and understand a program.</p> <p>4. Data structures and algorithms</p> <p>Programming is always about data structures and algorithms. If you want to understand the logic of program execution, it is necessary to understand the algorithms and data structures used.</p> <p>The above is not so much the core of binary security as it is the core knowledge of computer science. If we compare various vulnerability techniques to various moves in martial arts novels, this knowledge is the \"internal\" martial arts. Moves are easy to learn and limited, but the road to improve their \"internal\" is endless. The important thing to improve their own binary level is not to learn a variety of fancy use of skills, but to spend time to learn the basics.</p> <p>Unfortunately, some programmers and information security practitioners are often in a hurry to learn all kinds of vulnerability exploitation techniques. These core elements of computer science are not studied seriously instead. Students who sincerely hope to achieve good results in the CTF, and in the real reality of vulnerability mining, these basic content is often more important than a variety of exploitation techniques.

Based on the source code and compiled results (see Figure 6-1-1), it can be seen that the argument passing follows the traditional <code>cdecl</code> calling convention, i.e., function arguments are put on the stack from right to left, and the function arguments are cleared by the caller.</p> <p></p> <p>64-bit Linux programs, on the other hand, use the <code>fast call</code> calling method for passing parameters. The main difference between the 64-bit version compiled from the same source code and 32-bit is that the first six parameters of the function are passed in order using the RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, R9 registers, and if there are extra parameters, then the same stack is used for passing as in 32-bit, see Figure 6-1-2.</p> <p></p> <p>The PWN process also often requires direct calls to API functions provided by the operating system. Unlike in Windows, where the system API is called using the \"win32 api\" function, Linux is also characterized by its concise system calls.</p> <p>In the 32-bit Linux operating system, the system call requires the execution of the <code>int 0x80</code> soft interrupt instruction. At this point, <code>eax</code> stores the system call number, and the parameters of the system call are stored in EBX, ECX, EDX, ESI, EDI, EBP registers in turn. The return result of the call is stored in EAX. In fact, the system call can be regarded as a special function call, but using the <code>int 0x80</code> instruction instead of the call instruction. the function address in the call instruction becomes the system call number stored in EAX, and the parameters are passed using registers instead. Compared to the 32-bit system, the 64-bit Linux system call instruction becomes syscall, the registers for passing parameters become RDI, RSI, RDX, R10, R8, R9, and the system call corresponding to the system call number is changed. An example for the read system call is shown in Figure 6-1-3.</p> <p></p> <p>There are only 300+ system calls available for the Linux operating system, and the number may increase in the future with the kernel version update, but it is quite streamlined compared to Windows' hefty API.

The ELF header includes the ELF magic code, the computer architecture in which the program is running, the program entry, etc. It can be read by the \"readelf-h\" command and is generally used to find the entry point of some programs. The ELF file consists of several sections (sections), in which various data are stored. The sections in ELF are used to store a variety of data, including: </p> <p>\u2756 .text section - holds all the code needed to run a program. </p> <p>\u2756 .rdata section - holds unmodifiable static data used by the program, such as strings. </p> <p>\u2756 .data section - holds data that can be modified by a program, such as global variables that have been initialized in C, etc. </p> <p>\u2756 .bss section - used to store program modifiable data, which, unlike .data, is not initialized and therefore does not occupy ELF space. Although the .bss section exists in the section header table, there is no corresponding data in the file. The system does not request an empty block of memory for the actual .bss section until after the program starts execution. </p> <p>\u2756 The .plt section and the .got section - these two sections are needed in conjunction with the program to call functions in the dynamic link library (SO file) to get the address of the called function.</p> <p>Due to the extensibility of the ELF format, it is even possible to create custom sections when compiling a linked program.ELF can actually include a lot of content unrelated to program execution, such as program version, Hash, or some symbolic debugging information. However, the operating system does not parse the information in ELF when executing an ELF program, but rather the ELF header and Program Head Table. The purpose of parsing the ELF header is to determine the instruction set architecture, ABI version, and other system support information of the program, and to read the program entry. Then, Linux parses the Program Head Table to determine which program segments need to be loaded. The program header table is actually an array of Program Head structures, each of which contains information about the segment's description. Like Windows, Linux also has a memory mapping file feature. When executing a program, the operating system needs to load the specified contents of the ELF file into the specified location in memory according to the segment information specified in the program header table. Therefore, the content of each program header mainly includes the segment type, its address in the ELF file, which address to load into memory, segment length, memory read/write attributes, etc.</p> <p>For example, the memory read/write attribute of the segment that holds code in ELF is readable and executable, while the segment that holds data is readable and writable or read-only, etc. Note that some segments may not have corresponding data content in the ELF file, such as uninitialized static memory. In order to compress the ELF file, only one field will exist in the program header table, and the operating system will perform the memory request and zero setting operations. The operating system also does not care about the exact contents in each segment, but simply loads each segment as required and points the PC pointer to the program entry.</p> <p>Here some people may be confused about the relationship between sections and segments and their difference, but in fact both are just two forms of explaining the data in ELF. Just like a person has multiple identities, ELF uses both segment and section formats to describe a piece of data, only with a different focus. The operating system doesn't need to care about the specific function of the data in ELF, it just needs to know which piece of data should be loaded into which piece of memory and the read/write properties of the memory, so it will divide the data according to segments.</p> <p>A compiler, debugger, or IDA needs to know what the data represents, so it parses the data by sections. Usually, sections are more subdivided than segments, e.g. .text, rdata are often divided into a segment. Some sections that are purely used to describe additional information about the program and have nothing to do with program operation will not even have a corresponding segment and will not be loaded into memory during program operation.</p>"},{"location":"CS315/Lab%202%20Secure%20Coding%20and%20Buffer%20Overflows/#vulnerability-mitigation-measures-under-linux","title":"Vulnerability Mitigation Measures under Linux","text":"<p>Modern operating systems use a number of means to mitigate the risk of a computer being attacked by a vulnerability, which are collectively referred to as vulnerability mitigation measures.</p> <p>1. NX</p> <p>NX protection, also known as DEP in Windows, is the setting of permissions on program memory at the granularity of pages through the Memory Protect Unit (MPU) mechanism of modern operating systems, with the basic rule that writable and executable permissions are mutually exclusive. Therefore, it is not possible to execute arbitrary code directly using shellcode in a program with NX protection enabled. All memory that can be modified to write shellcode is not executable, and all code data that can be executed is not modifiable.</p> <p>NX protection is enabled by default in GCC and can be turned off by adding the \"-z execstack\" parameter at compile time.</p> <p>2. Stack Canary</p> <p>Stack Canary protection is a protection mechanism designed specifically for stack overflow attacks. Since the main goal of stack overflow attack is to overwrite the return address of the high bit of the function stack by overflow, the idea is to write a word-length random data before the function starts execution, that is, before the return address, and check whether the value is changed before the function returns, if it is changed, it is considered that a stack overflow has occurred. The program will terminate directly.</p> <p>GCC uses Stack Canary protection by default, and the way to turn it off is to add the \"-fno-stack-protector\" parameter at compile time.</p> <p>3. ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)</p> <p>The purpose of ASLR is to randomize the stack address of the program and the load address of the dynamic link library, which are not read/write executable unmapped memory between these addresses to reduce the attacker's knowledge of the program memory structure. In this way, even if the attacker has laid out the shellcode and can control the jump, it still cannot execute the shellcode because the memory address structure is unknown.</p> <p>ASLR is a system-level protection mechanism, and is turned off by modifying the contents of the /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space file to 0.</p> <p>4. PIE</p> <p>Very similar to ASLR protection, the purpose of PIE protection is to allow randomized loading of the address of the executable ELF, thus making the memory structure of the program completely unknown to the attacker and further improving the security of the program.</p> <p>GCC is compiled with PIE enabled by adding the parameter \"-fpic-pie\". Newer versions of GCC have PIE enabled by default, and can be turned off by setting \"-no-pie\".</p> <p>5. Full Relro</p> <p>Full Relro protection is related to the Lazy Binding mechanism under Linux, and its main function is to prohibit the reading and writing of the .GOT.PLT table and some other related memory, thus preventing attackers from writing to the .GOT.PLT table to carry out attack exploitation means.</p> <p>GCC enables Full Relro by adding the parameter \"-z relro\".</p>"},{"location":"CS315/Lab%202%20Secure%20Coding%20and%20Buffer%20Overflows/#role-of-got-and-plt","title":"Role of GOT and PLT","text":"<p>.GOT.PLT and .PLT are two special sections that are usually present in ELF files.

Unlike memory corruptions such as stack overflows, which can be directly exploited by overwriting memory, integer overflows often require some conversion to overflow. There are two common conversions.</p> <p>1. integer overflow into buffer overflow</p> <p>An integer overflow can mutate a very small number into a very large number. For example, an unsigned underflow can turn a smaller number representing the buffer size into a very large integer by subtraction. This results in a buffer overflow.</p> <p>Another case is to bypass some length checks by entering a negative number. For example, some programs will use signed numbers to represent length. Then a negative number can be used to bypass the length limit check. Most system APIs use unsigned numbers to represent length, so the negative number will become a large positive number and lead to overflow.</p> <p>2. integer overflow to array overrun</p> <p>The idea of array overrun is very simple. In C, the operation of array indexing is achieved by simply adding the array pointer to the index, and does not check the bounds. Therefore, a very large index will access the data after the array, and if the index is negative, then it will also access the memory before the array.</p> <p>Usually, integer overflows to array bounds are more common. In the process of array indexing, the array index is also multiplied by the length of the array element to calculate the actual address of the element. In the case of an array of type int, for example, the array index needs to be multiplied by 4 to calculate the offset. If the bounds check is bypassed by passing in a negative number, then normally only the memory before the array can be accessed. However, since the index is multiplied by 4, it is still possible to index the data after the array or even the entire memory space. For example, to index the contents at 0x1000 bytes after the array, just pass in the negative number -2147482624, which is expressed as 0x80000400 in hexadecimal numbers, and then multiply it by the element length 4, which is 0x00001000 due to the unsigned integer overflow result. as you can see, array overruns are easier to exploit compared to integer overflows to buffer overflows.</p>"},{"location":"CS315/Lab%202%20Secure%20Coding%20and%20Buffer%20Overflows/#stack-overflow","title":"Stack Overflow","text":"<p>The stack is a simple and classical data structure whose main feature is the use of first-in, last-out (FILO) access to the data on the stack.

Stack Overflow Principle</p> <p>Stack overflow is one of the buffer overflows. Local variables of a function are usually stored on the stack. If these buffers overflow, it is a stack overflow. The most classic way to exploit stack overflow is to overwrite the return address of a function in order to hijack the control flow of the program.</p> <p>The x86 architecture typically uses the instruction call to call a function and the instruction ret to return. when the CPU executes the call instruction, it first puts the address of the next instruction of the current call instruction on the stack and then jumps to the called function. When the called function needs to return, it only needs to execute the ret instruction, and the CPU will come out with the address of the top of the stack and assign it to the EIP register. This address, which is used to tell the called function where it should return to the calling function, is called the return address. Ideally, the address taken out is the address deposited by the previous call to call. This allows the program to return to the parent function and continue execution. The compiler will always make sure that even if the child function uses the stack and modifies the top of the stack, it will restore the top of the stack to the state it was in when it first entered the function before the function returns, thus ensuring that the return address fetched will not be incorrect.</p> <p></p> <p>Use the following command to compile the program of Example 6-3-1, turn off address randomization and stack overflow protection.</p> <pre><code>gcc -fno-stack-protector stack.c -o stack -no-pie\n</code></pre> <p>Run the program, debug with IDA, after entering 8 A, exit vuln function, the program executes ret instruction, the stack layout is shown in Figure 6-3-1. At this time, the top of the stack is saved 0x400579 that return address, after executing ret instruction, the program will jump to the location of 0x400579. Note that there is a string of 0x414141414141414141 above the return address, which is the 8 A's just entered. Since the get function does not check the length of the input data, it can increase the input until the return address is covered. From Figure 6-3-1, you can see that the return address is 18 bytes away from the first A. If you input more than 19 bytes, the return address will be overwritten.</p> <p>Analyzing this program with IDA, we can learn that the location of the shell function is 0x400537, and our purpose is to make the program jump to this function so as to execute system (\"/bin/sh\") to get a shell.</p> <p>In order to facilitate the input of some non-visible characters (such as address), here used to answer the PWN topic very useful tool pwntools, code comments will explain some of the commonly used functions, more specific instructions please refer to the official documentation.</p> <p></p> <p>The attack script is as follows.</p> <p></p> <p>Use IDA to attach to the process for trace debugging, just to the location of ret, the return address has been overwritten to 0x400537, continue to run the program will jump to the shell function, so as to obtain the shell (see Figure 6-3-2).</p> <p></p> <p>2. Stack protection technology</p> <p>Stack overflows are very difficult to exploit and very harmful. In order to alleviate the growing security problems caused by stack overflows, compiler developers introduced the Canary mechanism to detect stack overflow attacks.</p> <p>Canary translates to canary in Chinese. The Canary protection mechanism is similar to this, by inserting a random number in front of the stack where rbp is stored, so that if an attacker uses a stack overflow vulnerability to overwrite the return address, it will also overwrite the Canary. The compiler adds a piece of code before the function ret instruction that will check if the value of Canary has been overwritten. If it is rewritten, an exception is thrown directly, interrupting the program and thus preventing the attack from occurring.</p> <p>But this method is not always reliable, as in Example 6-3-2.</p> <p></p> <p>Enable stack protection at compile time.</p> <pre><code>gcc stack2.c -no-pie -fstack-protector-all -o stack2\n</code></pre> <p>When vuln function enters, it will take the value of Canary from fs:28, put it into the location of rbp-8, compare the value of rbp-8 with the value in fs:28 before the function exits, and if it is changed, call __stack_chk_fail function, output error message and exit the program (see Figure 6-3-3 and Figure 6-3-4).</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>But this program will print the input string before the vuln function returns, which will leak the Canary on the stack and thus bypass the detection. Here you can control the length of the string to just connect to the Canary, which will make the Canary and the string printed together by the puts function. Since the lowest byte of the Canary is 0x00, an extra character needs to be sent to overwrite 0x00 in order to prevent it from being truncated by 0.</p> <p></p> <p>In the next input, the leaked canary can be written to the original address and then continue to overwrite the return address:</p> <p></p> <p>The above example illustrates that even if the compiler has protection enabled, you still need to pay attention to prevent stack overflow when writing the program, otherwise it may be exploited by attackers, which can have serious consequences.</p> <p>3. Dangerous functions where stack overflows often occur</p> <p>By looking for dangerous functions, we can quickly determine if a program may have a stack overflow and where the stack overflow is located. The common dangerous functions are as follows.</p> <p>\u2756 Input: gets(), which reads a line directly up to the newline character '\\n', while '\\n' is converted to '\\x00'; scanf(), which formats a string in which %s does not check the length; vscanf(), as above.</p> <p>\u2756 Output: sprintf(), writes the formatted content to the buffer, but does not check the buffer length.</p> <p>\u2756 String: strcpy(), stops when '\\x00' is encountered, does not check the length, often prone to single-byte write 0 (off by one) overflow; strcat(), same as above.</p> <p>4. Available stack overflow coverage locations</p> <p>There are usually three types of stack overflow override locations available:</p> <p>\u2460 Override the function return address, the previous examples are controlled by overriding the return address program.</p> <p>\u2461 Overwrite the value of the BP register saved on the stack. The function will be called to save the stack site first, and then restore it when it returns, as follows (take x64 program as an example) When called.</p> <p></p> <p>When returning: If the BP value on the stack is overwritten, the BP value of the main caller function will be changed after the function returns, and when the main caller function returns to the line ret, the SP will not point to the original return address location, but the BP location after being modified.</p> <p>\u2462 Depending on the realistic execution, overwriting the content of a specific variable or address may lead to some logic vulnerabilities.</p>"},{"location":"CS315/Lab%202%20Secure%20Coding%20and%20Buffer%20Overflows/#assignment","title":"Assignment","text":""},{"location":"CS315/Lab%202%20Secure%20Coding%20and%20Buffer%20Overflows/#kfc-crazy-thursday","title":"KFC crazy Thursday","text":"<p>On sale!</p> <p>This challenge must create a dynamic docker and connect via domain or DNS.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Outside university <code>nc 116.7.234.225 port</code></p> </li> <li> <p>inside university <code>nc 10.20.55.12 port</code></p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"CS315/Lab%202%20Secure%20Coding%20and%20Buffer%20Overflows/#buffer-overflow-in-heap","title":"Buffer overflow in heap","text":"<p>A heap of the heap.</p> <p>This challenge must create a dynamic docker and connect via domain or DNS.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Outside university <code>nc 116.7.234.225 port</code></p> </li> <li> <p>inside university <code>nc 10.20.55.12 port</code></p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"CS315/Lab%202%20Secure%20Coding%20and%20Buffer%20Overflows/#love-kernel","title":"Love kernel","text":"<p>(None)</p> <p><code>nc 103.102.44.94 8306</code></p>"},{"location":"CS315/Lab%203%20Secure%20Coding%20and%20Format-String%20Vulnerability/","title":"Lab 3: Secure Coding and Format-String Vulnerability","text":""},{"location":"CS315/Lab%203%20Secure%20Coding%20and%20Format-String%20Vulnerability/#formatted-string-vulnerability","title":"Formatted String Vulnerability","text":""},{"location":"CS315/Lab%203%20Secure%20Coding%20and%20Format-String%20Vulnerability/#basic-principles-of-formatted-string-vulnerability","title":"Basic Principles of Formatted String Vulnerability","text":"<p>The commonly used formatted output functions in C are as follows:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Their usage is similar, and this section uses printf as an example.

Here is a recommended tool: https://github.com/denny0223/scrabble, the use of which is also very simple.</p> <pre><code>./scrabble http://example.com/\n</code></pre> <p>Build the Web environment locally by yourself, see Figure 1-1-1.</p> <p></p> <p>Run the tool, you can get the source code, get the flag, see Figure 1-1-2.</p> <p></p> <p>(2) git rollback</p> <p>As a version control tool, git records every commit, so when there is a git leak, the flag (sensitive) file may be deleted or overwritten in the revision, then we can use git's \"git reset\" command to restore to the previous version. See Figure 1-1-3 for a local web environment.</p> <p></p> <p>We first use the scrabble tool to get the source code, and then use the \"git reset--hard HEAD^\" command to jump to the previous version (in git, the current version is represented by HEAD, and the previous version is HEAD^) to get the source code, see Figure 1-1-4.</p> <p></p> <p>In addition to using \"git reset\", a simpler way to see what files have been modified by each commit is to use the \"git log-stat\" command, and then use \"git diff HEAD commit-id\" to compare the changes between the current version and the commit you want to see.</p> <p>(3) git branches</p> <p>Each time you commit, git automatically strings them together into a timeline, which is a branch. And git allows multiple branches, thus allowing users to separate work from the main development thread so that it doesn't interfere with it. If no new branches are created, then there is only one timeline, i.e., only one branch, which defaults to the master branch in git. So the flags or sensitive files we are looking for may not be hidden in the current branch, so using the \"git log\" command will only find the changes made on the current branch, but not the information we want, so we need to switch branches to find the files we want.</p> <p>Most off-the-shelf git leaks do not support branches, so if you need to restore code from another branch, you often need to extract the files by hand, so here is an example of the more powerful GitHacker (https://github.com/WangYihang/GitHacker) tool. Just run the command \"python GitHacker.py http://127.0.0.1:8000/.git/\". Once you run it, you'll see the folder you created locally, but if you run \"git log--all\" or \"git branch-v\", you'll only see the master branch. If you run \"git reflog\", you can see some checkout records, see Figure 1-1-5.</p> <p></p> <p>As you can see, there is a secret branch in addition to the master branch, but the automation tool only restores the information of the master branch, so you need to manually download the head information of the secret branch and save it to .git/refs/heads/secret (execute the command \"wget http:// 127.0.0.1:8000/.git/refs/heads/secret\"). After restoring the head information, we can reuse some of the GitHacker code to automate the branch restoration process. As you can see in GitHacker's code, he downloads the object file first, then uses git fsck to detect it, and continues to download the missing file. Here you can directly reuse the fixmissing function that detects missing files and restores them. Let's comment out the last part of the program that calls main and change it to the following code.</p> <p></p> <p>If you run \"python GitHacker.py\" again, go to the folder you created, and run \"git log--all\" or \"git branch-v\" command, you will be able to recover the secret branch information, find the corresponding commit hash from the git log, and execute the command \"git diff HEAD b94c\" (b94c is the first 4 bits of the hash) to get the flag, see Figure 1-1-6.</p> <p></p> <p>(4) Other uses of git leaks</p> <p>In addition to the common exploit of viewing the source code, the leaked git may also contain other useful information, such as the .git/config folder may contain access_token information, which allows access to other repositories of this user.</p> <p>2. SVN vulnerability</p> <p>SVN (subversion) is the source code version management software, the main reason for SVN source code vulnerability is the administrator's irregular operation to expose the SVN hidden folder to the external network environment, you can use the .svn/entries or wc.db file to obtain the server source code and other information. Here we recommend two tools: https://github.com/kost/dvcs-ripper and Seay-svn (source code backup vulnerability exploit tool for Windows).</p> <p>3. HG leak</p> <p>When initializing the project, HG will create a .hg hidden folder under the current folder, which contains information such as code and branch modification records. Here is a recommended tool: https://github.com/kost/dvcs-ripper.</p> <p>4. Summary of experience</p> <p>Whether it is .git these hidden files or sensitive backend folders like admin in practice, the key lies in the power of the dictionary, and the reader can do secondary development on the basis of certain tools to meet their needs. Here is a recommended open source directory scanning tool: https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch.</p> <p>CTF online competitions often have problems with redirects of one kind or another. For example, as soon as you visit .git, it will return 403, at this time try to visit .git/config, if there are file content returned, it means that there is a git leak, and vice versa, generally does not exist. In SVN leaks, the source code is usually crawled in the entries, but sometimes there are cases where the entries are empty, then pay attention to the existence of the wc.db file or not, and you can get the source code in the pristine folder through the checksum there.</p>"},{"location":"CS315/Lab%204%20Scanning%2C%20Reconnaissance%2C%20and%20Penetration%20Testing/#sensitive-backup-files","title":"Sensitive backup files","text":"<p>Through some sensitive backup files, we can often get the source code of a file, or the whole directory of a website, etc.</p> <p>1. gedit backup files</p> <p>Under Linux, after saving with the gedit editor, a file with the suffix \"~\" will be generated in the current directory, whose contents are the contents of the file just edited.

The following is a brief introduction to the formation process of executable files and common executable file types, so that readers can have a preliminary knowledge of them.</p> <p>1. The formation process of executable files (compilation and linking)</p> <p>For readers who are new to this area, it is crucial to form a proper understanding and sense of executable files. Again, as something created by human civilization, executable files are not generated directly as if by magic, but through a series of steps.</p> <p>The vast majority of normal executables are generated by compiling a high-level language. In general, these processes occur when compiling:</p> <p>&lt;1&gt; The user takes a set of source code written in a high-level language as input to the compiler.</p> <p>&lt;2&gt; The compiler parses the input and generates the corresponding assembly code for each source code file.</p> <p>&lt;3&gt; The assembler receives the compiler-generated assembly code and continues to perform assembly operations, temporarily storing each copy of the generated machine code in the respective object file.</p> <p>&lt;4&gt; Now multiple object files have been generated, but the final goal is to generate an executable file. So the linker gets involved, interconnecting the scattered object files and processing them into a complete program. Then, according to the format of the executable file, it fills in various parameters specifying the running environment of the program and finally forms a complete executable file.</p> <p>In the actual environment, there is more or less information loss in each step of the process due to the need to consider the size of the generated executable, the runtime performance of the executable, and the protection of information. For example, the comment information in the source code is generally discarded in the compilation stage, the label (label) name in the assembly code may be discarded in the assembly, and the symbolic information such as function name and type name may be discarded in the linking.</p> <p>Reverse requires the use of knowledge and experience to restore some of this information, and thus restore all or part of the program flow to achieve various purposes of the analyst.</p> <p>2. Executable files in different formats</p> <p>In practice, due to historical legacy and competition between companies, etc., the various files generated in each step described above will have multiple file formats. For example, Windows systems use PE (Portable Executable) executables, while Linux systems use ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) executables. Since both executable formats are developed from COFF (Common File Format) format, various concepts in the file structure are very similar.</p> <p>PE file consists of DOS header, PE file header, section table and data of each section; meanwhile, if you need to refer to external dynamic link library, there is import table; if you can provide functions to other programs to dynamically.</p> <p>The ELF file consists of the ELF header, section data, section table, string segment, and symbol table.</p> <p>Sections are logical divisions of sections in a program, usually with specific names, such as .text or .code for code sections, .data for data sections, etc. At runtime, the sections of an executable are loaded into various locations in memory, and one or more sections are mapped into a Segment for ease of management and to save overhead. Segments are divided according to the permissions (read, write, execute) required for this part of memory. If an illegal operation is performed in the corresponding segment, such as a write operation in a code segment that can only be read and executed, a Segmentation Fault is generated.</p> <p>Since the basic format details of PE and ELF are fully disclosed and there are a lot of mature tools for parsing and modifying them, we will not explain these format details in detail here.</p>"},{"location":"CS315/Lab%205%20Reverse%20Engineering%20and%20Obfuscation/#assembly-language-basics","title":"Assembly Language Basics","text":"<p>After parsing the file, the reverser is confronted with a large piece of machine code, which is directly generated by the assembly language.</p> <p>The following is an introduction to the key concepts of assembly language, so that readers can quickly understand assembly language.</p> <p>1. Registers, memory and addressing</p> <p>Register is a part of CPU, which is a high-speed storage component with limited storage capacity, used to temporarily store instructions, data and addresses. A typical IA-32 (Intel Architecture, 32-bit), or x86 architecture processor contains the following registers that are explicitly visible in instructions:</p> <p>\u2756 General-purpose registers EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, ESI, EDI.</p> <p>\u2756 Top-of-stack pointer register ESP, bottom-of-stack pointer register EBP.</p> <p>\u2756 Instruction counter EIP (holds the address of the next address of the next instruction to be executed).</p> <p>\u2756 Segment registers CS, DS, SS, ES, FS, GS.</p> <p>For the x86-64 architecture, based on these registers above, the prefix E is changed to R to mark 64 bits, and eight general-purpose registers, R8 to R15, are added. In addition, for the 16-bit case, the prefix E is removed altogether. 16-bit, there are certain restrictions on the use of registers, which will not be repeated in this book since they are not mainstream now.</p> <p>For general-purpose registers, the program can use all of them or only part of them. The corresponding helpers for different parts of the registers are shown in Figure 5-1-1, where the naming rules for splitting R8 to R15 are R8d (low 32 bits), R8w (low 16 bits) and R8b (low 8 bits).</p> <p></p> <p>There is also a flag register in the CPU, where each bit indicates the value of the corresponding flag bit. The commonly used flag bits are as follows.</p> <p>\u2756 AF: Auxiliary Carry Flag, set to 1 when the result of the operation is entered in the third bit.</p> <p>\u2756 PF: Parity Flag, set to 1 when the lowest valid byte of the operation result has an even number of ones.</p> <p>\u2756 SF: Sign Flag, set to 1 when the sign bit of the sign shaping is 1, representing that it is It means it is a negative number.</p> <p>\u2756 ZF: Zero Flag, set to 1 when the operation result is all zeros.</p> <p>\u2756 OF: Overflow Flag, set to 1 when the operation result is a signed number and overflows.</p> <p>\u2756 CF: Carry Flag, set to 1 when the operation result is fed above the highest bit, used to determine the overflow of unsigned numbers.</p> <p>The CPU can operate not only on registers, but also on memory cells, so there are many different addressing methods. Table 5-1-1 shows the different addressing methods of CPU, examples and the corresponding operation objects.</p> <p></p> <p>It is easy to see that \"[]\" is equivalent to the \"*\" operator in C (indirect access).</p> <p>In the x86/x64 architecture, the four addressing methods, namely register indirect addressing, base addressing, variable addressing, and base plus variable addressing, are almost identical in terms of the functions they achieve, but there are semantic differences. In the 16-bit era, these four addressing methods cannot be mixed. In modern compilers, the compiler will choose the appropriate addressing method based on semantics and optimization.</p> <p>2. x86/x64 assembly language</p> <p>The x86/x64 assembly language exists in two display/writing styles, Intel and AT&amp;T, and this chapter will unify the Intel style.</p> <p>What is machine code? What is assembly language? Machine code is a binary instruction executed directly on the CPU, and assembly language is a kind of helper for machine language, assembly language and machine code are one-to-one correspondence. Machine code varies according to CPU architecture. The most common CPU architectures for CTF and usual are x86 and x86-64 (x64).</p> <p>The basic format of x86/x64 assembly instructions is as follows.</p> <p>Where the presence or absence and form of operands is determined by the type of operand. Due to space limitation, this section cannot describe the format and functions of various instructions in an exhaustive manner. Table 5-1-2 gives the forms, functions, and corresponding high-level language writing methods of several common instructions. Entry-level CTF participants do not need to master how to write assembly language programs fluently, but only need to master the common instructions described below and be able to read and understand them when they encounter them.</p> <p></p> <p>There are many conditional jump instructions in assembly language, and they will jump conditionally depending on the flag bits. A cmp instruction for comparison often exists before the conditional jump instruction and will set the flag bit accordingly based on the result of the comparison (the effect on the flag bit is equivalent to the sub instruction).</p> <p>Table 5-1-3 shows the common conditional jump instructions and the cmp and flag bits they are based on.</p> <p></p> <p>3. Disassembly</p> <p>While high-level languages often require a complex compilation process, the assembly process simply translates the assembly statements directly into the corresponding machine code and places the statements directly adjacent to each other. Therefore, we can easily translate the machine code back to assembly language, and such a process is called disassembly.</p> <p>As mentioned in Section 5.1.2, the assembly process also has information loss. Although we can easily parse and restore the content of a given instruction, we must know which data is machine code before we can parse it accordingly. The von Neumann architecture blurs the boundary of distinction between code and data, and jump tables, pools of constants (ARMs), ordinary constant data, and even malicious interference data may be interspersed in code sections. Therefore, simply and directly parsing instructions down one by one in succession is often problematic. We need to know the correct starting position of the instruction (e.g., label, which is used to indicate a location of the program for jumping and addressing) to guide the disassembly tool to parse the code correctly.</p> <p>As mentioned above, the label information is lost during the assembly process. Because the label is used to identify the jump position, it determines where the program is likely to be executed when it is executed, i.e., where the assembly statement starts. Therefore, restoring the correct label information is essential to correctly restore the program execution flow.</p> <p>In spite of the missing information, we can still successfully restore the program flow by using some algorithms. Two known algorithms are described below: the linear scan disassembly algorithm and the recursive descent disassembly algorithm.</p> <p>The linear scan disassembly algorithm is simple and brute-force, parsing instructions one after another directly from the beginning of the code segment until the end. The disadvantage is that once data is inserted into the segment, all subsequent disassembly results are wrong and useless.</p> <p>Instead of simply parsing the instructions and displaying them, the recursive descent disassembly algorithm is a new algorithm created after discovering the problems with the linear scan disassembly algorithm, which tries to speculate how the program will be executed after each instruction is executed. For example, a normal instruction will execute directly to the next one after execution, an unconditional jump instruction will immediately jump to the target location, a function call instruction will temporarily jump out and return to continue execution, a return instruction will terminate the current execution process, and a conditional jump instruction may split into two paths that go to different locations under different conditions. The engine first matches some known patterns (patterns) to the starting position, then traces the execution of the program one by one according to the execution pattern of the instructions, and finally disassembles the program completely.</p> <p>4. Calling convention</p> <p>As the size of the software increases, the number of developers continues to increase, the relationship between functions synchronization becomes more and more complex, if each developer uses different rules to pass function parameters, the program will often be a variety of unbelievable errors, the program maintenance costs will become very large. For this reason, after the advent of compilers, some conventions, called calling conventions, were created for compilers to specify the passing of arguments between functions. The common calling conventions are as follows.</p> <p>(1) Calling convention for x86 32-bit architecture</p> <p>\u2756 __cdecl: parameters are pressed onto the stack in order from right to left, and when the call is finished, the caller is responsible for cleaning up these pressed parameters and placing the return value in EAX. The vast majority of C programs for x86 platforms use this convention.</p> <p>\u2756 __stdcall: The arguments are also pressed onto the stack from right to left, and the caller is responsible for cleaning up the pressed arguments after the call, with the return value also placed in EAX.</p> <p>\u2756 __thiscall: A calling convention optimized specifically for class methods, which places the this pointer of the class method in the ECX register and then presses the rest of the arguments onto the stack.</p> <p>\u2756\\ __fastcall: A calling convention made for speeding up calls by placing the 1st argument in ECX, placing the 2nd argument in EDX, and then pressing the subsequent arguments onto the stack from right to left.</p> <p>(2) Calling convention for x86 64-bit architecture</p> <p>\u2756 Microsoft x64 bit (x86-64) calling convention: used on Windows, the first 4 parameters are put into the 4 registers RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX in turn, and then the remaining parameters are pressed into the stack from right to left.</p> <p>\u2756 SystemV x64 calling convention: used on Linux, MacOS, two more registers than Microsoft's version, use the 6 registers RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, R9 to pass the first 6 parameters, and press the rest on the stack from right to left.</p> <p>5. Local variables</p> <p>When writing programs, programmers often use local variables. But in assembly there are only registers, stacks, writable segments and heaps, where should the local variables of a function exist? It is important to note that local variables are \"volatile\": once the function returns, all local variables become invalid. Given this property, local variables are stored on the stack, and each time a function is called, the program allocates a section of space on the stack to store the local variables.</p> <p>Each function, when called, creates such a region for local variables, a region for storing return addresses, and a region for arguments, see Figure 5-1-2. The program calls the function one layer deeper, and each function's own region is stacked on the stack one layer at a time.</p> <p></p> <p>People call this area of each function itself a frame, and because these frames are on the stack, they are also called stack frames. However, the memory area of the stack is not necessarily fixed, and the location of the stack frames can vary with each call's path, so how can local variables be referenced correctly?</p> <p>While the contents of the stack will always keep changing as it goes in and out of the stack, the offset of each local variable in a function relative to the stack frame of that function is fixed. So a register can be introduced to specifically store the location of the current stack frame, i.e., ebp, called the frame pointer. The program assigns ebp to a location in the middle of the stack frame during the function initialization phase, so that all local variables can be referenced with ebp. Since the parent function on the upper level also has to use ebp, it is necessary to save ebp at the beginning of the function and then assign ebp to the value of its own stack frame, such a flow is the classic combination in assembly code.</p> <p></p> <p>The stack frame of each function now consists of four parts: local variables, the value of the parent stack frame, the return address, and the parameters. It can be seen that ebp, after initialization, actually points to the location where the address of the parent stack frame is stored. Therefore, *ebp forms a chain table representing a chain of function calls at one level.</p> <p>With the development of compilation technology, the compiler can also refer to local variables by tracking the location of the stack at the time of each instruction execution, thus directly crossing over ebp and using the stack pointer esp instead. This saves the time needed to save ebp each time and adds a general-purpose register, thus improving program performance.</p> <p>So now there are two kinds of functions: those with frame pointers, and those optimized without frame pointers. Modern analysis tools (e.g. IDA Pro, etc.) will use advanced stack pointer tracing methods to target these two types of functions so that local variables are handled correctly.</p>"},{"location":"CS315/Lab%205%20Reverse%20Engineering%20and%20Obfuscation/#introduction-to-common-tools","title":"Introduction to common tools","text":"<p>This section introduces the tools commonly used in software reverse engineering, the specific use of tools will be described in subsequent sections.</p> <p>1.

Users can use tools such as file to view the architecture information of the file, but a more convenient solution is to open a random architecture of IDA, and then you can know the architecture information of the file when loading, see Figure 5-2-2, IDA shows that the file is an x86-64 architecture ELF64 file, so switch to the 64bit version of IDA to open again, after opening the pop-up will be \"Load a new file\" dialog box.</p> <p></p> <p>2. Load a file</p> <p>The options in the \"Load a new file\" dialog box are mainly for advanced users, beginners can use the default settings, do not need to change, click the \"OK\" button, load the file into the IDA. Click the \"No\" button to enter the normal disassembly interface. At this point, IDA will generate a database (IDB) for the file, the entire file required content into it, see Figure 5-2-3. later analysis will no longer need to access the input file, the various changes to the database will also be independent of the input file.</p> <p>The interface in Figure 5-2-3 is divided into several parts, which are described below.</p> <p>\u2756 Navigation bar: Shows the distribution of different types of data (ordinary functions, code of undefined functions, data, undefined, etc.) of the program.</p> <p>\u2756 Main window of disassembly: Displays the result of disassembly, control flow diagram, etc., which can be dragged, selected, etc.</p> <p>\u2756 Function window: displays all function names and addresses (drag the scroll bar below to see them), and can be filtered by Ctrl+F key combination.</p> <p>\u2756 Output window: display the log of IDA during running, you can also enter commands in the input box below and execute them.</p> <p>\u2756 Status Indicator: Showing as \"AU: idle\" means IDA has finished the automated analysis of the program.</p> <p>In the disassembly window, use the right-click menu or the shortcut key space to switch between control flow diagram and text interface disassembly, see Figure 5-2-4.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>3. Data Type Operation</p> <p>One of the highlights of IDA is that the user can freely control the flow of disassembly through interface interaction. In the process of loading the file, IDA has done its best to automatically define the type of a large number of locations for the user, such as IDA correctly labeled most of the data in the code segment as code type and disassembled it, and labeled some of the locations in the special segment as 8-byte integer qword. however, IDA's ability is limited and generally does not correctly label all data types, and the user can correct the problems with IDA by correctly defining the type of a 1-byte or segment area for better disassembly work.</p> <p>Lower versions of IDA do not have an undo function, so you need to be careful before operating and to master the opposite operation corresponding to these operations.</p> <p>The user can distinguish the type of data in a location by the color of the address. The location marked as code, its address will be shown in black; the location marked as data, gray display; undefined data type location will be shown in yellow, black box location that is the different color address, see Figure 5-2-5.</p> <p></p> <p>The following are some of the shortcut keys for the defined data types. When using these shortcut keys, you need to have the focus (cursor) on the corresponding line in order for them to take effect.</p> <p>\u2756 U (Undefine) key: This is to cancel the existing data type definition in a place, and a confirmation dialog box will pop up.</p> <p>\u2756 D (Data) key: i.e., make a certain position into data. IDA to prevent misuse, if the operation of defining data will affect the location of the existing data type, IDA will pop up a confirmation dialog box; if the operation of location and its vicinity are completely Undefined, the confirmation dialog box will not pop up.</p> <p>\u2756 C (Code) key: i.e., make a location into a command. The timing of the confirmation dialog pop-up is also similar to the D key. After being defined as a command, IDA will automatically use this as the starting position for recursive descending disassembly.</p> <p>Above are the basic shortcuts for defining data. To cope with the increasing complexity of data types, IDA also has various built-in data types, such as arrays, strings, etc.</p> <p>\u2756 A (ASCII) key: It will define a string type ending with \"\\0\" starting from this position, see Figure 5-2-6.</p> <p></p> <p>\u2756 * key: Define this as an array, and then a dialog box will pop up to set the properties of the array.</p> <p>\u2756 O (Offset) key: Define this as an address offset, see Figure 5-2-7.</p> <p></p> <p>4. Function Operation</p> <p>In fact, disassembly is not completely continuous, but rather a patchwork of scattered individual functions. Each function has local variables, calling conventions and other information, and control flow diagrams can only be generated and displayed in terms of functions, so it is also very important to define functions correctly. IDA also has operations for handling functions.</p> <p>\u2756 Delete a function: After selecting a function in the function window, press Delete.</p> <p>\u2756 Define a function: After selecting the corresponding line in the disassembly window, press P.</p> <p>\u2756 Modify function parameters: Select and press the Ctrl+E key combination in the function window, or press Alt+P key combination inside the function in the disassembly window.</p> <p>After defining the function, IDA can perform many function-level analyses, such as call convention analysis, stack variable analysis, function call parameter analysis, etc. These analyses are of direct and great help to restore the high-level semantics of disassembly.</p> <p>5. Navigation</p> <p>Although it is possible to switch between different functions by mouse clicks, as the size of the program increases, it seems unrealistic to use this way to locate them. \u00ee IDA has the function of navigation history, similar to Explorer and browser history, which allows you to go back or forward to a certain browsing place.</p> <p>\u2756 Go back to the previous location: shortcut Esc.</p> <p>\u2756 Go forward to the next location: shortcut Ctrl+Enter.</p> <p>\u2756 Jump to a specific location: shortcut G, then you can enter the address/already defined name.</p> <p>\u2756 Jump to a particular zone: shortcut Ctrl+S, and then you can select the zone.</p> <p>6. Type manipulation</p> <p>IDA has developed a type analysis system to handle various data types (function declarations, variable declarations, structure declarations, etc.) of C/C++ language and allows users to specify them freely. This definitely makes the reduction of disassembly more accurate. Select the variable, function and press Y, \"Please enter the type declaration\" dialog box, enter the correct C type, IDA can parse and automatically apply the type.</p> <p>7. IDA mode of operation</p> <p>IDA shortcut key design has a certain pattern, so we can strengthen the memory of the shortcut key, so that the reverse speed faster and more comfortable.</p> <p>Here are some operation patterns and learning techniques summarized in the usual practice.</p> <p>\u2756 Various operations in IDA's disassembly window will have different functions when selected and when unselected. For example, the operation corresponding to the shortcut key C can specify the scan area for recursive descending disassembly when the disassembly window is selected.</p> <p>\u2756 Some of the shortcut keys in IDA's disassembly window have different functions when used multiple times. For example, the shortcut key O will resume the first operation when used a second time on the same location.</p> <p>\u2756 IDA's right-click shortcut menu will be labeled with various shortcut keys.</p> <p>\u2756 IDA's dialog box buttons can be replaced by mouse clicks by pressing their initials (e.g. the \"Yes\" button can be replaced by mouse clicks by pressing the Y key).</p> <p>We can master these patterns to quickly learn IDA shortcuts, and basically do not need to press the control keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift) shortcut features make IDA operation more interesting.</p> <p>8. IDAPython</p> <p>IDAPython is a Python environment built into IDA, you can perform a variety of database operations through the interface, it can now execute most of the C++ functions in the IDA SDK and all IDC functions, it can be said to have both the convenience of IDC and the power of the C++SDK.</p> <p>Press Alt+F7 key combination, or select \"File\u2192Script file\" menu command, you can execute Python script files; output window also has a Python Console box, you can temporarily execute Python statements; press Shift+F2 key combination, or Select the \"File\u2192Script command\" menu command to open the script panel, and change \"Scripting language\" to \"Python \", you can get a simple editor, see Figure 5-2-8.</p> <p></p> <p>9 IDA's other functions</p> <p>IDA's menu bar \"View\u2192Open subviews\" can open various types of windows, see Figure 5-2-9.</p> <p></p> <p>Strings window: press Shift+F12 to open it, see Figure 5-2-10, you can identify the strings in the program, double-click to locate the target string in the disassembly window.</p> <p></p> <p>Hexadecimal window: Opened by default, you can press F2 to modify the data in the database, and press F2 again to apply the changes after modification.</p>"},{"location":"CS315/Lab%205%20Reverse%20Engineering%20and%20Obfuscation/#getting-started-with-hexrays-decompiler","title":"Getting Started with HexRays Decompiler","text":"<p>The basic operations of IDA introduced in section 5.2.1 are to allow IDA to correctly identify the data types and functions of a location. These operations partially restore the information loss caused by the linker and assembler mentioned in the executable (see section 2.4.7). The decompiler presented in this section will try to restore the information loss caused by the compiler and continue to restore the functions composed of these assembly instructions to a read-friendly form. Therefore, getting the decompiler to work correctly requires the correct definition of data types and the correct identification of functions.</p> <p>This section introduces HexRays Decompiler (HexRays for short), the world's most advanced and sophisticated decompiler that is publicly available. HexRays runs as a plug-in to IDA and is developed by the same company as IDA and has a strong connection to IDA. hexRays makes full use of the function local variables and data types determined by IDA, and generates C-like pseudocode after optimization. Users can browse the generated pseudocode, add comments, rename identifiers, modify variable types, switch the data display format, etc.</p> <p>1. generate pseudocode</p> <p>To use this plug-in, you need to let it generate pseudocode. The operation required to generate pseudocode is very simple, just locate the target function in the disassembly window and press the F5 key. Once the plug-in is running, a window will open showing the decompiled pseudocode, see Figure 5-2-11. Selecting the list of functions on the left side allows you to switch to a different function without returning to the disassembly window.</p> <p>When the cursor moves to identifiers, keywords, and constants, the same content in other positions will be highlighted for easy viewing and operation.</p> <p>2. Pseudocode Composition</p> <p>The pseudocode generated by HexRays has a certain structure. After decompiling each function, the first line is the prototype of the function, then the declaration area of local variables, and finally the statements of the function.</p> <p>The upper part of this is the variable declaration area. Sometimes the area for larger functions can be too long to read and can be collapsed by clicking \"Collapse declaration\".</p> <p>Note that the comments following each local variable actually represent the location of that variable. This information will make it easier to understand the behavior of the corresponding assembly code.</p> <p>In addition, most of the variable names in the pseudocode are automatically generated and may vary from machine to machine or from version to version of IDA.</p> <p>3. Modify Identifiers</p> <p>Looking at the IDA generated pseudocode 2-simpleCrackme.c (see Figure 5-2-12), you can see that HexRays is very powerful and has automatically named many variables. However, the names of these variables have no real meaning, and as the size of the function becomes larger, meaningless variable names will seriously affect the analysis efficiency. Therefore, HexRays provides users with the ability to change the name of an identifier: move the cursor to the identifier and press N to bring up the Change Name dialog box, enter a legal name in the input box, and click the OK button. The modified pseudo-code is easier to read and analyze.</p> <p></p> <p>Note: IDA generally allows the use of identifiers in line with the C language syntax, but will be used as a reservation of certain prefixes, in the manual specification of the name, such a prefix can not be used, please readers are prompted to change the name after being prompted for errors.</p> <p>4. switch the data display format</p> <p>After renaming, the 2-simpleCrackme.c pseudocode has been restored to be similar to the source code (see Figure 5-2-12). However, many constants are not displayed in the correct format, for example, 0x66 in the source code becomes decimal number 102, and 'a' and 'A' are converted to their ASCII counterparts of decimal numbers 97 and 65.</p> <p></p> <p>HexRays is not powerful enough to automatically label these constants, but HexRays provides the ability to display constants into various formats. Move the cursor over a constant and right-click to select the corresponding format in the pop-up shortcut menu, see Figure 5-2-13.</p> <p></p> <p>\u2756 Hexadecimal: Hexadecimal display, with the shortcut key H, can convert various other display formats back to numbers.</p> <p>\u2756 Octal: Octal display.</p> <p>\u2756 Char: Converts constants to a format shaped like 'A', the shortcut key is R.</p> <p>\u2756 Enum: Converts a constant to a value in an enumeration, the shortcut key is M.</p> <p>\u2756 Invert sign: convert a constant to a negative number by its complement, the shortcut key is _.</p> <p>\u2756 Bitwise negate: Invert the constant by bit, like ~0xF0 in C language, the shortcut key is ~. After the manual operation to convert some display format, the decompiled pseudocode is more consistent with the source code, see Figure 5-2-14.</p> <p></p> <p>HexRays shortcuts are sometimes not triggered, try using the right-click shortcut menu when it fails.</p> <p>5. Modifying Variable Types</p> <p>The companion file to this section is 2-simpleCrackme_O3. After compiler optimization, the difficulty of recovering the semantics increases exponentially. Even though HexRays are extremely powerful, they often have problems in the face of complex compiler optimizations.</p> <p>This section uses the executable generated by compiling with the GCC compiler with the O3 optimization switch turned on. The same source code undergoes a complex compiler optimization process and the resulting pseudocode can change quite a bit, see Figure 5-2-15.</p> <p></p> <p>The pseudocode converts some constants at the beginning to display format, which is the middle part of the string in the program stored as dword and qword, respectively. In fact, the original string assignment operation has become 128-bit floating-point assignment + 64-bit qword assignment + 32-bit dword assignment. HexRays thus identifies the string array as three variables: v6 of type __m128i, v7 of __int64, and v8 of int, resulting in poor readability of the pseudocode generated later.</p> <p>Hint: byte-1 byte integer type, 8 bits, char, __int8.</p> <p>word-2 byte integer, 16 bits, short, __int16.</p> <p>dword-4-byte integer, 32 bits, int, __int32.</p> <p>qword-8-byte integer, 64 bits, __int64, long long.</p> <p>The variables v6, v7, v8 are actually entire arrays of strings. If the user can correctly specify the type of the variables, the accuracy and readability of decompiling will be greatly improved.</p> <p>HexRays makes full use of the type analysis system of IDA introduced earlier. Press Y on the identifier of the type to be modified to bring up a dialog box to modify the type. For this program, according to the calculation, the 3 variables should actually be a char array of length 28 (16+8+4) starting with v6, so its corresponding C type declaration is char[28] (the identifier can be omitted in the type declaration).</p> <p>Then move the cursor to v6, press Y, type \"char[28]\", and a confirmation dialog box will pop up whether to overwrite the subsequent variables, click the \"Yes\" button.</p> <p>Rename these variables again, and you can get the readable pseudo-code, see Figure 5-2-16.</p> <p></p> <p>HexRays supports not only type modification of local variables, but also parameter types, function prototypes, global variable types, and so on. In fact, HexRays supports not only these simple types, but also C types such as structures and enumerations. Press Shift+F1 key combination to bring up the Local Types window, from which you can manipulate various types of C: press Insert, or right-click to bring up the Add Type dialog box, see Figure 5-2-17, from which you can enter a type that conforms to the simple syntax of C, and then IDA will parse and store the type. In addition, press Ctrl+F9 key combination or select \"File\u2192Load File\u2192Parse C header file\" menu command, you can load the C language header file.</p> <p></p> <p>After adding custom types, HexRays will automatically perform the corresponding parsing operations according to the types when setting variable types, such as displaying access to structures, displaying enumerations, etc.</p> <p>Various cases of type recognition errors may occur during the reverse process, and we need to use our experience in C programming to set variables such as structures, normal pointers, structure pointers, and integers correctly.</p> <p>In general, HexRays can increase the length of a variable by force (e.g., char[28] as mentioned above), but when changing a long variable to a short one, the alarm will often be \"Sorry, can not change variable type\" (e.g., change char[28] above to char[27]), so you need to be careful when changing a long variable to a shorter one. If you inadvertently modify the error, you can delete the function and then define the function to reset the various information of the function</p> <p>6. Complete the analysis</p> <p>After fine-tuning the pseudo-code to a level suitable for your reading, you can start the analysis. Obviously, this program implements the imitation projection cipher, and the method of finding the inverse is very simple, so I will not repeat it, and ask the reader to complete the decryption by himself.</p>"},{"location":"CS315/Lab%206%20IoT%20Security%20and%20Wireless%20Exploitation/","title":"Lab 6: IoT Security and Wireless Exploitation","text":"<p>AFL lives at https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/. It hasn't been updated in a while. While AFL still works fine, there's a new project AFL++, a fork of AFL with lots of improvements and new features. AFL++ can be found at https://aflplus.plus/ with its source on GitHub. This article will look at using AFL++ to fuzz IoT binaries.</p> <p>Fuzzing works best when we have the source code of the binary in question. Unfortunately for IoT binaries, this is often not the case. AFL++ (and AFL) ships with a companion tool (afl-gcc, afl-clang, etc) that works as a drop-in replacement to gcc, clang, or any other standard build tool. The tool is used to inject instrumentation in the generated binaries while compiling the source code. The instrumented binaries can then be fuzzed using afl-fuzz.</p> <p>Fuzzing closed-source applications is tricky. For fuzzing such binaries, AFL++ can use Qemu, unicorn, or Frida and are named qemu mode, unicorn mode, and Frida mode respectively. These are binary-only instrumentation modes and are not as efficient as the source code instrumentation modes. We will be using Qemu mode in this article.</p> <p>In Qemu mode, AFL++ uses qemu user mode emulation to run the binary. It uses a modified version of Qemu which instruments the basic blocks as the program executes. The instrumentation information thus generated is used to generate new test cases which trigger different code paths improving code coverage. AFL++ in qemu mode can also be used to instrument foreign arch binaries (like an arm binary on an x86_64 host). This is extremely useful for fuzzing IoT firmware binaries which are usually of ARM or MIPS architecture.</p> <p>An important point to note is that AFL++ and similar fuzzers (AFL, hongfuzz, radamsa[test case generator only]) only work with file inputs That is the program must only receive the fuzzed input from a file. Programs that take in input from a socket are not supported.</p> <p>For fuzzing socket-based programs we can take either of the following approaches:</p> <ul> <li>If the application's source code is available, rewrite the application to accept input from a file. Most of the time rewriting the entire application isn\u2019t necessary. We can code in a small test function that reads in a file and uses the data to call another function that we want to fuzz.</li> <li>For closed-source apps, rewriting the source isn\u2019t an option. In such cases, there are hacks to convert a socketed binary to use files instead. These methods usually use LD_PRELOAD to override socket functions and make them read/write from a file instead. Preeny and desockmulti are two such desocketing tools. However, these may not always work out of the box.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"CS315/Lab%206%20IoT%20Security%20and%20Wireless%20Exploitation/#compiling-afl","title":"Compiling AFL++","text":"<p>AFL++ can be compiled on any Linux system.

We do not have the source code of httpd which we can modify for our purpose. Hence we have to resort to binary-level modifications, such as patching the assembly instructions and <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> tricks. Using the latter we can override network functions in <code>libc</code> to make them accept input from a file instead. The desockmulti project on GitHub can be used for this purpose.</p> <p>Before showing how to use desockmulti, we need to make a few modifications of our own. The <code>httpd</code> binary currently forks to the background using the <code>daemon</code> function. We do not want this forking behavior during fuzzing.</p> <p></p> <p>We need to override the <code>daemon</code> such that it returns 0 without forking actually. This can be done both with LD_PRELOAD or by patching the assembly instructions.</p> <p>The other change that we need to make is to have httpd process exactly 1 request (unlike a typical web server that processes requests indefinitely) before quitting. This way we can know which request, if any, crashes the web server.</p> <p>To close a socket, <code>httpd</code> calls the <code>close</code> function. There are three locations from where close is called.</p> <p></p> <p>Among them, we need to modify the one at <code>231c0</code> to call <code>exit(0)</code> instead of <code>close</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>To patch the instructions we will use Cutter which is a GUI for radare2. Ghidra also supports patching binaries but Cutter is better suited for this use case.</p> <p>Navigating to <code>0x231c0</code> in Cutter, we come across the following disassembly.</p> <p></p> <p>Double-clicking on <code>close</code> takes us to <code>0x106b4</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>The <code>exit</code> function is located at <code>0x10b64</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>We can thus change <code>bl close</code> to <code>bl 0x10b64</code> to call the <code>exit</code> function instead.</p> <p></p> <p>The instruction immediately before can be changed from <code>mov r0, sl</code> to <code>eor r0, r0</code> which sets register <code>r0</code> to <code>0</code> to give us the following disassembly.</p> <p></p> <p>The net effect is that it calls <code>exit(0)</code>.  The other change we need to do is patch out the <code>daemon</code> call at <code>0x22CB4</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>We can change the instruction to <code>eor r0, r0</code> to make the application believe the call succeeded.</p> <p></p> <p>Finally, with the changes in place go to File -&gt; Commit changes to save the modifications.

They are:</p> <ul> <li>Network Forensics</li> <li>Image Forensics</li> <li>Memory Forensics</li> </ul>"},{"location":"CS315/Lab%207%20Forensics%20and%20Steganography%20Part%20I/#scope-of-forensics","title":"Scope of Forensics","text":"<p>When we talk about employment, research, or anything, Cyber Forensics is one of the prime areas which comes into a security analyst's mind. Forensics is strongly employed in Incident Response, Malware Analysis, and Data leak protection. To sum it up, every cybercrime is always related to cyber forensics.</p> <p>To understand this, let us look into a very dangerous virus attack that almost started world war III. Stuxnet was a virus that was found lurking in the systems which controlled nuclear centrifuges in Iran. Stuxnet had a stolen yet officially authorized digital signature which acted as a very good camouflage. Stuxnet made the windows systems constantly reboot or lead them to Blue Screen of Death. Stuxnet could easily affect any computer which was linked to the network. It was really difficult for security experts to trace it. It severely affected the SCADA systems which were employed in maintaining the rotation speed of the centrifuges. After heavy investigation, when several forensic analysts looked into the SCADA network transfer, they found a malicious program being run that altered the system processes. The main aspect which made Stuxnet almost invisible was that it became active only when its target was present or being run. Until then the virus remained dormant. So as you can see, Cyber forensics played a huge role in the detection of the virus.</p> <p>Let us look at the trend of cyber-attacks based on the analysis from January 2017-2018:</p> <p>Some handy definitions:</p> <ol> <li>Cyber Espionage: Use of computer networks to get access to confidential information held by important organizations.</li> <li>Hacktivism: Act of hacking which is mainly done for a political purpose.</li> <li>Cyber Warfare: Cyber attacks are done on state organizations to gain military secrets etc.</li> </ol> <p> Cyber crimes are at 77% in 2017</p> <p>Now let us look at January 2018: </p> <p>So as you can see, the percentage has increased at an alarming rate.</p> <p>So, folks, I hope you understand just how important cyber forensics is in the current world of cybersecurity.</p>"},{"location":"CS315/Lab%207%20Forensics%20and%20Steganography%20Part%20I/#image-forensics","title":"Image Forensics","text":""},{"location":"CS315/Lab%207%20Forensics%20and%20Steganography%20Part%20I/#introduction_1","title":"Introduction","text":""},{"location":"CS315/Lab%207%20Forensics%20and%20Steganography%20Part%20I/#what-is-image-forensics","title":"What is Image Forensics?","text":"<p>To keep it very simple and straight, Image Forensics is a specific branch of cyber forensics that deals with various numbers of attacks.</p> <p>Some of them include:</p> <ol> <li>The authenticity of an image</li> <li>When we speak of authenticity, we are talking about whether the image is properly structured or not.

In positional notation, the least significant bit is also known as the rightmost bit. It is the opposite of the most significant bit, which carries the highest value in a multiple-bit binary number as well as the number which is farthest to the right. In a multi-bit binary number, the significance of a bit decreases as it approaches the least significant bit. Since it is binary, the most significant bit can be either 1 or 0. The least significant bit is frequently employed in hash functions, checksums, and pseudorandom number generators.</p> <p>When transmission of binary data is being done, the least significant bit is the one that is transmitted first, followed by other bits of increasing significance.</p> <p>The number of image pixels in a PNG file is generally composed of RGB three primary colors (red, green, and blue).

The program terminates when the instruction pointer moves past the last command.</p> <p>The brainfuck language uses a simple machine model consisting of the program and instruction pointer, as well as a one-dimensional array of at least 30,000 byte cells initialized to zero; a movable data pointer (initialized to point to the leftmost byte of the array); and two streams of bytes for input and output (most often connected to a keyboard and a monitor respectively, and using the ASCII character encoding).</p>"},{"location":"CS315/Lab%208%20Forensics%20and%20Steganography%20Part%20II/#commands","title":"Commands","text":"<p>The eight language commands each consist of a single character:</p> Character Meaning <code>&gt;</code> Increment the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the right). <code>&lt;</code> Decrement the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the left). <code>+</code> Increment (increase by one) the byte at the data pointer. <code>-</code> Decrement (decrease by one) the byte at the data pointer. <code>.</code> Output the byte at the data pointer. <code>,</code> Accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer. <code>[</code> If the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching <code>]</code> command. <code>]</code> If the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching <code>[</code> command. <p>(Alternatively, the <code>]</code> command may instead be translated as an unconditional jump to the corresponding <code>[</code> command, or vice versa; programs will behave the same but will run more slowly, due to unnecessary double searching.)</p> <p><code>[</code> and <code>]</code> match as parentheses usually do: each <code>[</code> matches exactly one <code>]</code> and vice versa, the <code>[</code> comes first, and there can be no unmatched <code>[</code> or <code>]</code> between the two.</p> <p>Brainfuck programs can be translated into C using the following substitutions, assuming <code>ptr</code> is of type <code>char*</code> and has been initialized to point to an array of zeroed bytes:</p> brainfuck command C equivalent (Program Start) <code>char array[30000] = {0}; char *ptr = array;</code> <code>&gt;</code> <code>++ptr;</code> <code>&lt;</code> <code>--ptr;</code> <code>+</code> <code>++*ptr;</code> <code>-</code> <code>--*ptr;</code> <code>.</code> <code>putchar(*ptr);</code> <code>,</code> <code>*ptr = getchar();</code> <code>[</code> <code>while (*ptr) {</code> <code>]</code> <code>}</code> <p>As the name suggests, Brainfuck programs tend to be difficult to comprehend. This is partly because any mildly complex task requires a long sequence of commands and partly because the program's text gives no direct indications of the program's state. These, as well as Brainfuck's inefficiency and its limited input/output capabilities, are some of the reasons it is not used for serious programming. Nonetheless, like any Turing complete language, Brainfuck is theoretically capable of computing any computable function or simulating any other computational model, if given access to an unlimited amount of memory.[8] A variety of Brainfuck programs have been written.[9] Although Brainfuck programs, especially complicated ones, are difficult to write, it is quite trivial to write an interpreter for Brainfuck in a more typical language such as C due to its simplicity. There even exist Brainfuck interpreters written in the Brainfuck language itself.[10][11]</p> <p>Brainfuck is an example of a so-called Turing tarpit: It can be used to write any program, but it is not practical to do so, because Brainfuck provides so little abstraction that the programs get very long or complicated.</p>"},{"location":"CS315/Lab%208%20Forensics%20and%20Steganography%20Part%20II/#malboge","title":"Malboge","text":"<p>An esoteric language that looks a lot like Base85... but isn't.

There are plenty of methods to find data which is seemingly deleted, not stored, or worse, covertly recorded.</p> <ul> <li>Cryptography</li> </ul> <p>Cryptography is the reason we can use banking apps, transmit sensitive information over the web, and in general protect our privacy. However, a large part of CTFs is breaking widely used encryption schemes which are improperly implemented. The math may seem daunting, but more often than not, a simple understanding of the underlying principles will allow you to find flaws and crack the code.</p> <p>The word \u201ccryptography\u201d technically means the art of writing codes. When it comes to digital forensics, it\u2019s a method you can use to understand how data is constructed for your analysis.</p> <ul> <li>Web Exploitation</li> </ul> <p>Websites all around the world are programmed using various programming languages. While there are specific vulnerabilities in each programming langage that the developer should be aware of, there are issues fundamental to the internet that can show up regardless of the chosen language or framework.</p> <p>These vulnerabilities often show up in CTFs as web security challenges where the user needs to exploit a bug to gain some kind of higher level privileges.</p> <ul> <li>Reverse Engineering</li> </ul> <p>Reverse Engineering in a CTF is typically the process of taking a compiled (machine code, bytecode) program and converting it back into a more human readable format.</p> <p>Very often the goal of a reverse engineering challenge is to understand the functionality of a given program such that you can identify deeper issues.</p> <ul> <li>Binary Exploitation</li> </ul> <p>Binaries, or executables, are machine code for a computer to execute. For the most part, the binaries that you will face in CTFs are Linux ELF files or the occasional windows executable.

D-BUS was designed from scratch to fulfil the needs of a modern Linux system.</p> <p>D-BUS, as a full-featured IPC and object system, has several intended uses. First, D-BUS can perform basic application IPC, allowing one process to shuttle data to another\u2014think UNIX domain sockets on steroids. Second, D-BUS can facilitate sending events, or signals, through the system, allowing different components in the system to communicate and ultimately to integrate better. For example, a Bluetooth daemon can send an incoming call signal that your music player can intercept, muting the volume until the call ends. Finally, D-BUS implements a remote object system, letting one application request services and invoke methods from a different object\u2014think CORBA without the complications. (From here).</p> <p>D-Bus uses an allow/deny model, where each message (method call, signal emission, etc.) can be allowed or denied according to the sum of all policy rules which match it.

Each team works finding vulnerabilities in other team\u2019s services while protecting their own, hence \u201cattack/defense\u201d.</p> <p></p> <p>(image from CTF.zone)</p> <p>All teams are given an image to host on servers, usually a Linux distribution with code for several services that the game creators made. For example, in this year\u2019s saarCTF, there were some simple websites for food reviews and calendar events hosted on a linux server. All teams get the same images, so if you find a vulnerability in your server, you can use it to attack other teams\u2019.</p> <p>When the competition starts, you gain access to the servers and can start reading the code and looking for vulnerabilities. The game admins will use your service (programmatically) as normal users and place \u201cflags\u201d for other teams to steal if they find vulnerabilities. For example, they might create private events in the calendar app mentioned earlier, and the flags would be in the details of the event.</p> <p>Vulnerabilities are generally intentionally placed, though sometimes game creators make mistakes and there are extra unintentional attack paths. Competitions tend to have a range of easy to more complicated exploits.</p> <p>A simple exploit might be finding that the <code>view_calendar_event</code> function takes in a uid from the request, and doesn\u2019t validate that this is the same user as the logged in user. A more complicated exploit could involve a buffer overflow leading to a remote code execution. There\u2019s also been exploits using less traditional methods, like adversarial machine learning: fausecteam/faustctf-2018-jodlgang.</p> <p>After finding a vulnerability, the next step is to build a script to exploit it on other teams\u2019 servers and patch the issue on your own server. Points are determined based on how many opposing teams you\u2019re able to steal flags from and how many flags you successfully prevent other teams from stealing.</p>"},{"location":"CS315/2021/Week%2014/#rules","title":"Rules","text":"<p>Competition start time: 2021-12-13 21:00</p> <p>Competition end time: 2021-12-16 21:00</p> <p>Time per round: 5 minutes (864 rounds in total)</p> <p>Score per round: 50</p> <p>Challenges:</p> <ul> <li>Sanity_check (web)</li> <li>Calculator (web)</li> <li>Binary (pwn)</li> <li>Image manipulator (web)</li> <li>Blog (web)</li> </ul> <p>Base score per challenge: 1000</p> <p>Total teams: 50</p> <p>Flag location: <code>/var/flag.txt</code></p> <p>SSH user: <code>ctf</code></p> <p>SSH default password: <code>123456</code></p>"},{"location":"CS315/2021/Week%2014/#challenges","title":"Challenges","text":"<p>The AWD CTF has 5 challenges in total.

An example of that would be:</p> <pre><code>www.example.com,CNAME,www.example.com.cdn.cloudflare.net.\n</code></pre> <p>Another example is. If you have the domains mail.example.com and webmail.example.com. You can have webmail.example.com point to mail.example.com. So anyone visiting webmail.example.com will see the same thing as mail.example.com. It will NOT redirect you. Just show you the same content.</p> <p>Another typical usage of CNAME is to link www.example.com to example.com</p> <p>CNAME is quite convenient. Because if you change the A-record. The IP-address, you don't need to change the other subdomains, like ftp.example.com or www.example.com. Since they both point to example.com, which is a A-record and points directly to the IP.</p> <p>Another note. If foo.example.com points to bar.example.com, that mean that bar.example.com is the CNAME (Canonical/real/actual Name) of foo.example.com.</p> <p>Alias</p> <p>Kind of like CNAME in that it points to another name, not an IP.</p> <p>MX - Mail exchange</p> <p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MX_record</p>"},{"location":"CS315/2021/Week%204/#find-subdomains_1","title":"Find Subdomains","text":"<p>Finding subdomains is fundamental.

Not recommended: Vulnrable to dictionary attacks, no server authentication and no way to generate per session wired equivalent privacy (WEP) keys.</li> <li>EAP-TLS (Transport Layer Security): It relies on client-side and server-side certificates to perform authentication and can be used to dynamically generate user-based and session-based WEP keys to secure subsequent communications.</li> <li>EAP-TTLS (Tunneled Transport Layer Security): Mutual authentication of the client and network through an encrypted channel (or tunnel), as well as a means to derive dynamic, per-user, per-session WEP keys. Unlike EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS requires only server-side certificates (client will use credentials).</li> <li>PEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol): PEAP is like the EAP protocol but creating a TLS tunnel to protect the communication. Then, weak authentication protocols can by used on top of EAP as they will be protected by the tunnel.</li> <li>PEAP-MSCHAPv2: This is also known as just PEAP because it is widely adopted. This is just the vulnerable challenge/response called MSCHAPv2 on to of PEAP (it is protected by the TLS tunnel).</li> <li>PEAP-EAP-TLS or just PEAP-TLS: Is very similar to EAP-TLS but a TLS tunnel is created before the certificates are exchanged.</li> </ul> <p>You can find more information about these authentication methods here and here.</p>"},{"location":"CS315/2021/Week%207/#username-capture","title":"Username Capture","text":"<p>Reading https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3748#page-27 it looks like if you are using EAP the \"Identity\" messages must be supported, and the username is going to be sent in clear in the \"Response Identity\" messages.</p> <p>Even using one of the most secure of authentication methods: PEAP-EAP-TLS, it is possible to capture the username sent in the EAP protocol.

In a WiFi environment, the access point (AP) typically generates an EAP-Identity request as part of the association process.  To preserve anonymity, the EAP client on the user\u2019s system may respond with only enough information to allow the first hop RADIUS server to process the request, as shown in the following examples.</p> <ul> <li>EAP-Identity = anonymous</li> </ul> <p>In this example, all users will share the pseudo-user-name \u201canonymous\u201d.  The first hop RADIUS server is an EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS server which drives the server end of the PEAP or TTLS protocol.  The inner (protected) authentication type will then be either handled locally or proxied to a remote (home) RADIUS server.</p> <ul> <li>EAP-Identity = anonymous@realm_x</li> </ul> <p>In this example, users belonging to different realms hide their own identity but indicate which realm they belong to so that the first hop RADIUS server may proxy the EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS requests to RADIUS servers in their home realms which will act as the PEAP or TTLS server.  The first hop server acts purely as a RADIUS relay node.</p> <p>Alternatively, the first hop server may act as the EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS server and either process the protected authentication method or proxy it to another server.  This option may be used to configure different policies for different realms.</p> <p>In EAP-PEAP, once the PEAP server and the PEAP client establish the TLS tunnel, the PEAP server generates an EAP-Identity request and transmits it down the TLS tunnel.  The client responds to this second EAP-Identity request by sending an EAP-Identity response containing the user\u2019s true identity down the encrypted tunnel.  This prevents anyone eavesdropping on the 802.11 traffic from discovering the user\u2019s true identity.</p> <p>EAP-TTLS works slightly differently.  With EAP-TTLS, the client typically authenticates via PAP or CHAP protected by the TLS tunnel.  In this case, the client will include a User-Name attribute and either a Password or CHAP-Password attribute in the first TLS message sent after the tunnel is established.</p> <p>With either protocol, the PEAP/TTLS server learns the user\u2019s true identity once the TLS tunnel has been established.  The true identity may be either in the form user@realm or simply user**.  If the PEAP/TTLS server is also authenticating the user**, it now knows the user\u2019s identity and proceeds with the authentication method being protected by the TLS tunnel.  Alternatively, the PEAP/TTLS server may forward a new RADIUS request to the user\u2019s home RADIUS server.  This new RADIUS request has the PEAP or TTLS protocol stripped out.  If the protected authentication method is EAP, the inner EAP messages are transmitted to the home RADIUS server without the EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS wrapper.  The User-Name attribute of the outgoing RADIUS message contains the user\u2019s true identity \u2013 not the anonymous identity from the User-Name attribute of the incoming RADIUS request.  If the protected authentication method is PAP or CHAP (supported only by TTLS), the User-Name and other authentication attributes recovered from the TLS payload are placed in the outgoing RADIUS message in place of the anonymous User-Name and TTLS EAP-Message attributes included in the incoming RADIUS request.</p>"},{"location":"CS315/2021/Week%207/#eap-bruteforce-password-spray","title":"EAP-Bruteforce (password spray)","text":"<p>If the client is expected to use a username and password (notice that EAP-TLS won't be valid in this case), then you could try to get a list a usernames (see next part) and passwords and try to bruteforce the access using air-hammer.</p> <pre><code>./air-hammer.py -i wlan0 -e Test-Network -P UserPassword1 -u usernames.txt\n</code></pre> <p>You could also do this attack using <code>eaphammer</code>:</p> <pre><code>./eaphammer --eap-spray \\\n    --interface-pool wlan0 wlan1 wlan2 wlan3 wlan4 \\\n    --essid example-wifi \\\n    --password bananas \\\n    --user-list users.txt\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"CS315/2021/Week%207/#client-attacks-theory","title":"Client attacks Theory","text":""},{"location":"CS315/2021/Week%207/#network-selection-and-roaming","title":"Network Selection and Roaming","text":"<p>Although the 802.11 protocol has very specific rules that dictate how a station can join an ESS, it does not specify how the station should select an ESS to connect to.

In fact, many networks will have several network-extending access points all using the same name to expand access without confusing users.</p> <p>Due how the implementation of clients work (remember that the 802.11 protocol allows stations to roam freely between access points within the same ESS), it is possible to make a device to change the base station it is connected to.

This led to a significant drop in the number of stations that were vulnerable to karma attacks until 2015, when White and de Villiers developed a means of circumventing such protections. In White\u2019s and de Villiers\u2019 improved karma attack (MANA attack), directed probe responses are used to reconstruct the PNLs of nearby stations. When a broadcast probe request is received from a station, the attacker\u2019s access point responds with an arbitrary SSID from the station\u2019s PNL already being saw in a direct probe from that device.</p> <p>In resume, the MANA algorithm works like this: each time the access point receives a probe request, it first determines whether it\u2019s a broadcast or directed probe. If it\u2019s directed probe, the sender\u2019s MAC address is added to the hash table (if it\u2019s not there already) and the ESSID is added to that device\u2019s PNL. The AP then responds with a directed probe response.

Applying this concept to DNS request, it's possible that the domain requested that arrives to the DNS server isn't the same as the domain initially requested.</p> <p>For example a 1 bit modification in the domain microsoft.com can transform it into windnws.com. Attackers may register as many bit-flipping domains as possible related to the victim in order to redirect legitimate users to their infrastructure.</p> <p>For more information read https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hijacking-traffic-to-microsoft-s-windowscom-with-bitflipping/</p> <p>All possible bit-flipping domain names should be also monitored.</p>"},{"location":"CS315/2021/Week%209/#basic-checks","title":"Basic checks","text":"<p>Once you have a list of potential suspicions domain names you should check them (mainly the ports HTTP and HTTPS) to see if they are using some login form similar to someone of the victim's domain.

It's also interesting to know how old each discovered suspicions domain is, the younger it's the riskier it is.

In order to automate this I would recommend to to have a list of login forms of the victims domains, spider the suspicions web pages and compare each login form found inside the suspicions domains with each login form of the victim's domain using something like <code>ssdeep</code>.

If you want to know how to become a hacker, though, only two are relevant.</p> <p>There is a community, a shared culture, of expert programmers and networking wizards that traces its history back through decades to the first time-sharing minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments. The members of this culture originated the term \u2018hacker\u2019. Hackers built the Internet. Hackers made the Unix operating system what it is today. Hackers make the World Wide Web work. If you are part of this culture, if you have contributed to it and other people in it know who you are and call you a hacker, you're a hacker.</p> <p>The hacker mindset is not confined to this software-hacker culture. Some people apply the hacker attitude to other things, like electronics or music \u2014 actually, you can find it at the highest levels of any science or art. Software hackers recognize these kindred spirits elsewhere and may call them \u2018hackers\u2019 too \u2014 and some claim that the hacker nature is independent of the particular medium the hacker works in. But in the rest of this document, we will focus on the skills and attitudes of software hackers, and the traditions of the shared culture that originated the term \u2018hacker\u2019.</p> <p>There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, but aren't. These are people (mainly adolescent males) who get a kick out of breaking into computers and phreaking the phone system. Real hackers call these people \u2018crackers\u2019 and want nothing to do with them. Real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible, and not very bright, and object that being able to break security doesn't make you a hacker any more than being able to hotwire cars makes you an automotive engineer.

That's a mouthful. In simpler words, Docker is a tool that allows developers, sys-admins, etc. to easily deploy their applications in a sandbox (called containers) to run on the host operating system i.e. Linux. The key benefit of Docker is that it allows users to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development. Unlike virtual machines, containers do not have high overhead and hence enable more efficient usage of the underlying system and resources.</p>"},{"location":"CTF/Docker/#what-are-containers","title":"What are containers?","text":"<p>The industry standard today is to use Virtual Machines (VMs) to run software applications.

But this isolation comes at a great cost \u2014 the computational overhead spent virtualizing hardware for a guest OS to use is substantial.</p> <p>Containers take a different approach: by leveraging the low-level mechanics of the host operating system, containers provide most of the isolation of virtual machines at a fraction of the computing power.</p>"},{"location":"CTF/Docker/#why-use-containers","title":"Why use containers?","text":"<p>Containers offer a logical packaging mechanism in which applications can be abstracted from the environment in which they run.

This gives developers the ability to create predictable environments that are isolated from the rest of the applications and can be run anywhere.</p> <p>From an operations standpoint, apart from portability containers also give more granular control over resources giving your infrastructure improved efficiency which can result in better utilization of your compute resources.</p> <p></p> <p>Google Trends for Docker</p> <p>Due to these benefits, containers (&amp; Docker) have seen widespread adoption.

Let's now run a Docker container based on this image. To do that we are going to use the almighty <code>docker run</code> command.</p> <pre><code>$ docker run busybox\n</code></pre> <p>Wait, nothing happened! Is that a bug? Well, no. Behind the scenes, a lot of stuff happened. When you call <code>run</code>, the Docker client finds the image (busybox in this case), loads up the container and then runs a command in that container. When we run <code>docker run busybox</code>, we didn't provide a command, so the container booted up, ran an empty command and then exited. Well, yeah - kind of a bummer. Let's try something more exciting.</p> <pre><code>$ docker run busybox echo \"hello from busybox\"\nhello from busybox\n</code></pre> <p>Nice - finally we see some output. In this case, the Docker client dutifully ran the <code>echo</code> command in our busybox container and then exited it. If you've noticed, all of that happened pretty quickly. Imagine booting up a virtual machine, running a command and then killing it. Now you know why they say containers are fast! Ok, now it's time to see the <code>docker ps</code> command. The <code>docker ps</code> command shows you all containers that are currently running.</p> <pre><code>$ docker ps\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\n</code></pre> <p>Since no containers are running, we see a blank line. Let's try a more useful variant: <code>docker ps -a</code></p> <pre><code>$ docker ps -a\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES\n305297d7a235        busybox             \"uptime\"            11 minutes ago      Exited (0) 11 minutes ago                       distracted_goldstine\nff0a5c3750b9        busybox             \"sh\"                12 minutes ago      Exited (0) 12 minutes ago                       elated_ramanujan\n14e5bd11d164        hello-world         \"/hello\"            2 minutes ago       Exited (0) 2 minutes ago                        thirsty_euclid\n</code></pre> <p>So what we see above is a list of all containers that we ran. Do notice that the <code>STATUS</code> column shows that these containers exited a few minutes ago.</p> <p>You're probably wondering if there is a way to run more than just one command in a container. Let's try that now:</p> <pre><code>$ docker run -it busybox sh\n/ # ls\nbin   dev   etc   home  proc  root  sys   tmp   usr   var\n/ # uptime\n 05:45:21 up  5:58,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.04\n</code></pre> <p>Running the <code>run</code> command with the <code>-it</code> flags attaches us to an interactive tty in the container. Now we can run as many commands in the container as we want. Take some time to run your favorite commands.</p> <p>Danger Zone: If you're feeling particularly adventurous you can try <code>rm -rf bin</code> in the container. Make sure you run this command in the container and not in your laptop/desktop. Doing this will make any other commands like <code>ls</code>, <code>uptime</code> not work. Once everything stops working, you can exit the container (type <code>exit</code> and press Enter) and then start it up again with the <code>docker run -it busybox sh</code> command. Since Docker creates a new container every time, everything should start working again.</p> <p>That concludes a whirlwind tour of the mighty <code>docker run</code> command, which would most likely be the command you'll use most often. It makes sense to spend some time getting comfortable with it. To find out more about <code>run</code>, use <code>docker run --help</code> to see a list of all flags it supports. As we proceed further, we'll see a few more variants of <code>docker run</code>.</p> <p>Before we move ahead though, let's quickly talk about deleting containers. We saw above that we can still see remnants of the container even after we've exited by running <code>docker ps -a</code>. Throughout this tutorial, you'll run <code>docker run</code> multiple times and leaving stray containers will eat up disk space. Hence, as a rule of thumb, I clean up containers once I'm done with them. To do that, you can run the <code>docker rm</code> command. Just copy the container IDs from above and paste them alongside the command.</p> <pre><code>$ docker rm 305297d7a235 ff0a5c3750b9\n305297d7a235\nff0a5c3750b9\n</code></pre> <p>On deletion, you should see the IDs echoed back to you. If you have a bunch of containers to delete in one go, copy-pasting IDs can be tedious. In that case, you can simply run -</p> <pre><code>$ docker rm $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited)\n</code></pre> <p>This command deletes all containers that have a status of <code>exited</code>. In case you're wondering, the <code>-q</code> flag, only returns the numeric IDs and <code>-f</code> filters output based on conditions provided. One last thing that'll be useful is the <code>--rm</code> flag that can be passed to <code>docker run</code> which automatically deletes the container once it's exited from. For one off docker runs, <code>--rm</code> flag is very useful.</p> <p>In later versions of Docker, the <code>docker container prune</code> command can be used to achieve the same effect.</p> <pre><code>$ docker container prune\nWARNING! This will remove all stopped containers.\nAre you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y\nDeleted Containers:\n4a7f7eebae0f63178aff7eb0aa39f0627a203ab2df258c1a00b456cf20063\nf98f9c2aa1eaf727e4ec9c0283bcaa4762fbdba7f26191f26c97f64090360\n\nTotal reclaimed space: 212 B\n</code></pre> <p>Lastly, you can also delete images that you no longer need by running <code>docker rmi</code>.</p>"},{"location":"CTF/Docker/#terminology","title":"Terminology","text":"<p>In the last section, we used a lot of Docker-specific jargon which might be confusing to some.

The first thing we're going to look at is how we can run a dead-simple static website. We're going to pull a Docker image from Docker Hub, run the container and see how easy it is to run a webserver.</p> <p>Let's begin. The image that we are going to use is a single-page website that I've already created for the purpose of this demo and hosted on the registry - <code>prakhar1989/static-site</code>. We can download and run the image directly in one go using <code>docker run</code>. As noted above, the <code>--rm</code> flag automatically removes the container when it exits and the <code>-it</code> flag specifies an interactive terminal which makes it easier to kill the container with Ctrl+C (on windows).</p> <pre><code>$ docker run --rm -it prakhar1989/static-site\n</code></pre> <p>Since the image doesn't exist locally, the client will first fetch the image from the registry and then run the image. If all goes well, you should see a <code>Nginx is running...</code> message in your terminal. Okay now that the server is running, how to see the website? What port is it running on? And more importantly, how do we access the container directly from our host machine? Hit Ctrl+C to stop the container.</p> <p>Well, in this case, the client is not exposing any ports so we need to re-run the <code>docker run</code> command to publish ports. While we're at it, we should also find a way so that our terminal is not attached to the running container. This way, you can happily close your terminal and keep the container running. This is called detached mode.</p> <pre><code>$ docker run -d -P --name static-site prakhar1989/static-site\ne61d12292d69556eabe2a44c16cbd54486b2527e2ce4f95438e504afb7b02810\n</code></pre> <p>In the above command, <code>-d</code> will detach our terminal, <code>-P</code> will publish all exposed ports to random ports and finally <code>--name</code> corresponds to a name we want to give. Now we can see the ports by running the <code>docker port [CONTAINER]</code> command</p> <pre><code>$ docker port static-site\n80/tcp -&gt; 0.0.0.0:32769\n443/tcp -&gt; 0.0.0.0:32768\n</code></pre> <p>You can open http://localhost:32769 in your browser.</p> <p>Note: If you're using docker-toolbox, then you might need to use <code>docker-machine ip default</code> to get the IP.</p> <p>You can also specify a custom port to which the client will forward connections to the container.</p> <pre><code>$ docker run -p 8888:80 prakhar1989/static-site\nNginx is running...\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>To stop a detached container, run <code>docker stop</code> by giving the container ID. In this case, we can use the name <code>static-site</code> we used to start the container.</p> <pre><code>$ docker stop static-site\nstatic-site\n</code></pre> <p>I'm sure you agree that was super simple. To deploy this on a real server you would just need to install Docker, and run the above Docker command.

The <code>TAG</code> refers to a particular snapshot of the image and the <code>IMAGE ID</code> is the corresponding unique identifier for that image.</p> <p>For simplicity, you can think of an image akin to a git repository - images can be committed with changes and have multiple versions. If you don't provide a specific version number, the client defaults to <code>latest</code>. For example, you can pull a specific version of <code>ubuntu</code> image</p> <pre><code>$ docker pull ubuntu:18.04\n</code></pre> <p>To get a new Docker image you can either get it from a registry (such as the Docker Hub) or create your own. There are tens of thousands of images available on Docker Hub. You can also search for images directly from the command line using <code>docker search</code>.</p> <p>An important distinction to be aware of when it comes to images is the difference between base and child images.</p> <ul> <li>Base images are images that have no parent image, usually images with an OS like ubuntu, busybox or debian.</li> <li>Child images are images that build on base images and add additional functionality.</li> </ul> <p>Then there are official and user images, which can be both base and child images.</p> <ul> <li>Official images are images that are officially maintained and supported by the folks at Docker.

As a developer, you just tell EB how to run your app and it takes care of the rest - including scaling, monitoring and even updates. In April 2014, EB added support for running single-container Docker deployments which is what we'll use to deploy our app. Although EB has a very intuitive CLI, it does require some setup, and to keep things simple we'll use the web UI to launch our application.</p> <p>To follow along, you need a functioning AWS account.

But since our application is packaged in a Docker container, we just need to tell EB about our container. Open the <code>Dockerrun.aws.json</code> file located in the <code>flask-app</code> folder and edit the <code>Name</code> of the image to your image's name. Don't worry, I'll explain the contents of the file shortly.

We started with a simple static website and then tried a Flask app. Both of which we could run locally and in the cloud with just a few commands. One thing both these apps had in common was that they were running in a single container.</p> <p>Those of you who have experience running services in production know that usually apps nowadays are not that simple. There's almost always a database (or any other kind of persistent storage) involved. Systems such as Redis and Memcached have become de rigueur of most web application architectures. Hence, in this section we are going to spend some time learning how to Dockerize applications which rely on different services to run.</p> <p>In particular, we are going to see how we can run and manage multi-container docker environments. Why multi-container you might ask? Well, one of the key points of Docker is the way it provides isolation. The idea of bundling a process with its dependencies in a sandbox (called containers) is what makes this so powerful.</p> <p>Just like it's a good strategy to decouple your application tiers, it is wise to keep containers for each of the services separate. Each tier is likely to have different resource needs and those needs might grow at different rates. By separating the tiers into different containers, we can compose each tier using the most appropriate instance type based on different resource needs. This also plays in very well with the whole microservices movement which is one of the main reasons why Docker (or any other container technology) is at the forefront of modern microservices architectures.</p>"},{"location":"CTF/Docker/#sf-food-trucks","title":"SF Food Trucks","text":"<p>The app that we're going to Dockerize is called SF Food Trucks. My goal in building this app was to have something that is useful (in that it resembles a real-world application), relies on at least one service, but is not too complex for the purpose of this tutorial. This is what I came up with.</p> <p></p> <p>The app's backend is written in Python (Flask) and for search it uses Elasticsearch. Like everything else in this tutorial, the entire source is available on Github. We'll use this as our candidate application for learning out how to build, run and deploy a multi-container environment.</p> <p>First up, let's clone the repository locally.</p> <pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/prakhar1989/FoodTrucks\n$ cd FoodTrucks\n$ tree -L 2\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Dockerfile\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 aws-compose.yml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 docker-compose.yml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 flask-app\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 app.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 package-lock.json\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 package.json\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 static\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 templates\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 webpack.config.js\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 setup-aws-ecs.sh\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 setup-docker.sh\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 shot.png\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 utils\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 generate_geojson.py\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 trucks.geojson\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>flask-app</code> folder contains the Python application, while the <code>utils</code> folder has some utilities to load the data into Elasticsearch. The directory also contains some YAML files and a Dockerfile, all of which we'll see in greater detail as we progress through this tutorial. If you are curious, feel free to take a look at the files.</p> <p>Now that you're excited (hopefully), let's think of how we can Dockerize the app. We can see that the application consists of a Flask backend server and an Elasticsearch service. A natural way to split this app would be to have two containers - one running the Flask process and another running the Elasticsearch (ES) process. That way if our app becomes popular, we can scale it by adding more containers depending on where the bottleneck lies.</p> <p>Great, so we need two containers. That shouldn't be hard right? We've already built our own Flask container in the previous section. And for Elasticsearch, let's see if we can find something on the hub.</p> <pre><code>$ docker search elasticsearch\nNAME                              DESCRIPTION                                     STARS     OFFICIAL   AUTOMATED\nelasticsearch                     Elasticsearch is a powerful open source se...   697       [OK]\nitzg/elasticsearch                Provides an easily configurable Elasticsea...   17                   [OK]\ntutum/elasticsearch               Elasticsearch image - listens in port 9200.     15                   [OK]\nbarnybug/elasticsearch            Latest Elasticsearch 1.7.2 and previous re...   15                   [OK]\ndigitalwonderland/elasticsearch   Latest Elasticsearch with Marvel &amp; Kibana       12                   [OK]\nmonsantoco/elasticsearch          ElasticSearch Docker image                      9                    [OK]\n</code></pre> <p>Quite unsurprisingly, there exists an officially supported image for Elasticsearch. To get ES running, we can simply use <code>docker run</code> and have a single-node ES container running locally within no time.</p> <p>Note: Elastic, the company behind Elasticsearch, maintains its own registry for Elastic products. It's recommended to use the images from that registry if you plan to use Elasticsearch.</p> <p>Let's first pull the image</p> <pre><code>$ docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.3.2\n</code></pre> <p>and then run it in development mode by specifying ports and setting an environment variable that configures the Elasticsearch cluster to run as a single-node.</p> <pre><code>$ docker run -d --name es -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e \"discovery.type=single-node\" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.3.2\n277451c15ec183dd939e80298ea4bcf55050328a39b04124b387d668e3ed3943\n</code></pre> <p>Note: If your container runs into memory issues, you might need to tweak some JVM flags to limit its memory consumption.</p> <p>As seen above, we use <code>--name es</code> to give our container a name which makes it easy to use in subsequent commands. Once the container is started, we can see the logs by running <code>docker container logs</code> with the container name (or ID) to inspect the logs. You should see logs similar to below if Elasticsearch started successfully.</p> <p>Note: Elasticsearch takes a few seconds to start so you might need to wait before you see <code>initialized</code> in the logs.</p> <pre><code>$ docker container ls\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                 COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                            NAMES\n277451c15ec1        docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.3.2   \"/usr/local/bin/dock\u2026\"   2 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes        0.0.0.0:9200-&gt;9200/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9300-&gt;9300/tcp   es\n\n$ docker container logs es\n[2018-07-29T05:49:09,304][INFO ][o.e.n.Node               ] [] initializing ...\n[2018-07-29T05:49:09,385][INFO ][o.e.e.NodeEnvironment    ] [L1VMyzt] using [1] data paths, mounts [[/ (overlay)]], net usable_space [54.1gb], net total_space [62.7gb], types [overlay]\n[2018-07-29T05:49:09,385][INFO ][o.e.e.NodeEnvironment    ] [L1VMyzt] heap size [990.7mb], compressed ordinary object pointers [true]\n[2018-07-29T05:49:11,979][INFO ][o.e.p.PluginsService     ] [L1VMyzt] loaded module [x-pack-security]\n[2018-07-29T05:49:11,980][INFO ][o.e.p.PluginsService     ] [L1VMyzt] loaded module [x-pack-sql]\n[2018-07-29T05:49:11,980][INFO ][o.e.p.PluginsService     ] [L1VMyzt] loaded module [x-pack-upgrade]\n[2018-07-29T05:49:11,980][INFO ][o.e.p.PluginsService     ] [L1VMyzt] loaded module [x-pack-watcher]\n[2018-07-29T05:49:11,981][INFO ][o.e.p.PluginsService     ] [L1VMyzt] loaded plugin [ingest-geoip]\n[2018-07-29T05:49:11,981][INFO ][o.e.p.PluginsService     ] [L1VMyzt] loaded plugin [ingest-user-agent]\n[2018-07-29T05:49:17,659][INFO ][o.e.d.DiscoveryModule    ] [L1VMyzt] using discovery type [single-node]\n[2018-07-29T05:49:18,962][INFO ][o.e.n.Node               ] [L1VMyzt] initialized\n[2018-07-29T05:49:18,963][INFO ][o.e.n.Node               ] [L1VMyzt] starting ...\n[2018-07-29T05:49:19,218][INFO ][o.e.t.TransportService   ] [L1VMyzt] publish_address {172.17.0.2:9300}, bound_addresses {0.0.0.0:9300}\n[2018-07-29T05:49:19,302][INFO ][o.e.x.s.t.n.SecurityNetty4HttpServerTransport] [L1VMyzt] publish_address {172.17.0.2:9200}, bound_addresses {0.0.0.0:9200}\n[2018-07-29T05:49:19,303][INFO ][o.e.n.Node               ] [L1VMyzt] started\n[2018-07-29T05:49:19,439][WARN ][o.e.x.s.a.s.m.NativeRoleMappingStore] [L1VMyzt] Failed to clear cache for realms [[]]\n[2018-07-29T05:49:19,542][INFO ][o.e.g.GatewayService     ] [L1VMyzt] recovered [0] indices into cluster_state\n</code></pre> <p>Now, lets try to see if can send a request to the Elasticsearch container.

It's looking good! While we are at it, let's get our Flask container running too. But before we get to that, we need a <code>Dockerfile</code>. In the last section, we used <code>python:3.8</code> image as our base image. This time, however, apart from installing Python dependencies via <code>pip</code>, we want our application to also generate our minified Javascript file for production. For this, we'll require Nodejs. Since we need a custom build step, we'll start from the <code>ubuntu</code> base image to build our <code>Dockerfile</code> from scratch.</p> <p>Note: if you find that an existing image doesn't cater to your needs, feel free to start from another base image and tweak it yourself. For most of the images on Docker Hub, you should be able to find the corresponding <code>Dockerfile</code> on Github. Reading through existing Dockerfiles is one of the best ways to learn how to roll your own.</p> <p>Our Dockerfile for the flask app looks like below -</p> <pre><code># start from base\nFROM ubuntu:18.04\n\nMAINTAINER Prakhar Srivastav &lt;prakhar@prakhar.me&gt;\n\n# install system-wide deps for python and node\nRUN apt-get -yqq update\nRUN apt-get -yqq install python3-pip python3-dev curl gnupg\nRUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | bash\nRUN apt-get install -yq nodejs\n\n# copy our application code\nADD flask-app /opt/flask-app\nWORKDIR /opt/flask-app\n\n# fetch app specific deps\nRUN npm install\nRUN npm run build\nRUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt\n\n# expose port\nEXPOSE 5000\n\n# start app\nCMD [ \"python3\", \"./app.py\" ]\n</code></pre> <p>Quite a few new things here so let's quickly go over this file. We start off with the Ubuntu LTS base image and use the package manager <code>apt-get</code> to install the dependencies namely - Python and Node. The <code>yqq</code> flag is used to suppress output and assumes \"Yes\" to all prompts.</p> <p>We then use the <code>ADD</code> command to copy our application into a new volume in the container - <code>/opt/flask-app</code>. This is where our code will reside. We also set this as our working directory, so that the following commands will be run in the context of this location. Now that our system-wide dependencies are installed, we get around to installing app-specific ones. First off we tackle Node by installing the packages from npm and running the build command as defined in our <code>package.json</code> file. We finish the file off by installing the Python packages, exposing the port and defining the <code>CMD</code> to run as we did in the last section.</p> <p>Finally, we can go ahead, build the image and run the container (replace <code>yourusername</code> with your username below).</p> <pre><code>$ docker build -t yourusername/foodtrucks-web .\n</code></pre> <p>In the first run, this will take some time as the Docker client will download the ubuntu image, run all the commands and prepare your image. Re-running <code>docker build</code> after any subsequent changes you make to the application code will almost be instantaneous. Now let's try running our app.</p> <pre><code>$ docker run -P --rm yourusername/foodtrucks-web\nUnable to connect to ES. Retying in 5 secs...\nUnable to connect to ES. Retying in 5 secs...\nUnable to connect to ES. Retying in 5 secs...\nOut of retries. Bailing out...\n</code></pre> <p>Oops! Our flask app was unable to run since it was unable to connect to Elasticsearch. How do we tell one container about the other container and get them to talk to each other? The answer lies in the next section.</p>"},{"location":"CTF/Docker/#docker-network","title":"Docker Network","text":"<p>Before we talk about the features Docker provides especially to deal with such scenarios, let's see if we can figure out a way to get around the problem. Hopefully, this should give you an appreciation for the specific feature that we are going to study.</p> <p>Okay, so let's run <code>docker container ls</code> (which is same as <code>docker ps</code>) and see what we have.</p> <pre><code>$ docker container ls\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                 COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                            NAMES\n277451c15ec1        docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.3.2   \"/usr/local/bin/dock\u2026\"   17 minutes ago      Up 17 minutes       0.0.0.0:9200-&gt;9200/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9300-&gt;9300/tcp   es\n</code></pre> <p>So we have one ES container running on <code>0.0.0.0:9200</code> port which we can directly access. If we can tell our Flask app to connect to this URL, it should be able to connect and talk to ES, right? Let's dig into our Python code and see how the connection details are defined.</p> <pre><code>es = Elasticsearch(host='es')\n</code></pre> <p>To make this work, we need to tell the Flask container that the ES container is running on <code>0.0.0.0</code> host (the port by default is <code>9200</code>) and that should make it work, right? Unfortunately, that is not correct since the IP <code>0.0.0.0</code> is the IP to access ES container from the host machine i.e. from my Mac. Another container will not be able to access this on the same IP address. Okay if not that IP, then which IP address should the ES container be accessible by? I'm glad you asked this question.</p> <p>Now is a good time to start our exploration of networking in Docker. When docker is installed, it creates three networks automatically.</p> <pre><code>$ docker network ls\nNETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER              SCOPE\nc2c695315b3a        bridge              bridge              local\na875bec5d6fd        host                host                local\nead0e804a67b        none                null                local\n</code></pre> <p>The bridge network is the network in which containers are run by default. So that means that when I ran the ES container, it was running in this bridge network. To validate this, let's inspect the network.</p> <pre><code>$ docker network inspect bridge\n[\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"bridge\",\n        \"Id\": \"c2c695315b3aaf8fc30530bb3c6b8f6692cedd5cc7579663f0550dfdd21c9a26\",\n        \"Created\": \"2018-07-28T20:32:39.405687265Z\",\n        \"Scope\": \"local\",\n        \"Driver\": \"bridge\",\n        \"EnableIPv6\": false,\n        \"IPAM\": {\n            \"Driver\": \"default\",\n            \"Options\": null,\n            \"Config\": [\n                {\n                    \"Subnet\": \"172.17.0.0/16\",\n                    \"Gateway\": \"172.17.0.1\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        \"Internal\": false,\n        \"Attachable\": false,\n        \"Ingress\": false,\n        \"ConfigFrom\": {\n            \"Network\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"ConfigOnly\": false,\n        \"Containers\": {\n            \"277451c15ec183dd939e80298ea4bcf55050328a39b04124b387d668e3ed3943\": {\n                \"Name\": \"es\",\n                \"EndpointID\": \"5c417a2fc6b13d8ec97b76bbd54aaf3ee2d48f328c3f7279ee335174fbb4d6bb\",\n                \"MacAddress\": \"02:42:ac:11:00:02\",\n                \"IPv4Address\": \"172.17.0.2/16\",\n                \"IPv6Address\": \"\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"Options\": {\n            \"com.docker.network.bridge.default_bridge\": \"true\",\n            \"com.docker.network.bridge.enable_icc\": \"true\",\n            \"com.docker.network.bridge.enable_ip_masquerade\": \"true\",\n            \"com.docker.network.bridge.host_binding_ipv4\": \"0.0.0.0\",\n            \"com.docker.network.bridge.name\": \"docker0\",\n            \"com.docker.network.driver.mtu\": \"1500\"\n        },\n        \"Labels\": {}\n    }\n]\n</code></pre> <p>You can see that our container <code>277451c15ec1</code> is listed under the <code>Containers</code> section in the output. What we also see is the IP address this container has been allotted - <code>172.17.0.2</code>. Is this the IP address that we're looking for? Let's find out by running our flask container and trying to access this IP.</p> <pre><code>$ docker run -it --rm yourusername/foodtrucks-web bash\nroot@35180ccc206a:/opt/flask-app# curl 172.17.0.2:9200\n{\n  \"name\" : \"Jane Foster\",\n  \"cluster_name\" : \"elasticsearch\",\n  \"version\" : {\n    \"number\" : \"2.1.1\",\n    \"build_hash\" : \"40e2c53a6b6c2972b3d13846e450e66f4375bd71\",\n    \"build_timestamp\" : \"2015-12-15T13:05:55Z\",\n    \"build_snapshot\" : false,\n    \"lucene_version\" : \"5.3.1\"\n  },\n  \"tagline\" : \"You Know, for Search\"\n}\nroot@35180ccc206a:/opt/flask-app# exit\n</code></pre> <p>This should be fairly straightforward to you by now. We start the container in the interactive mode with the <code>bash</code> process. The <code>--rm</code> is a convenient flag for running one off commands since the container gets cleaned up when its work is done. We try a <code>curl</code> but we need to install it first. Once we do that, we see that we can indeed talk to ES on <code>172.17.0.2:9200</code>. Awesome!</p> <p>Although we have figured out a way to make the containers talk to each other, there are still two problems with this approach -</p> <ol> <li>How do we tell the Flask container that <code>es</code> hostname stands for <code>172.17.0.2</code> or some other IP since the IP can change?</li> <li>Since the bridge network is shared by every container by default, this method is not secure. How do we isolate our network?</li> </ol> <p>The good news that Docker has a great answer to our questions. It allows us to define our own networks while keeping them isolated using the <code>docker network</code> command.</p> <p>Let's first go ahead and create our own network.</p> <pre><code>$ docker network create foodtrucks-net\n0815b2a3bb7a6608e850d05553cc0bda98187c4528d94621438f31d97a6fea3c\n\n$ docker network ls\nNETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER              SCOPE\nc2c695315b3a        bridge              bridge              local\n0815b2a3bb7a        foodtrucks-net      bridge              local\na875bec5d6fd        host                host                local\nead0e804a67b        none                null                local\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>network create</code> command creates a new bridge network, which is what we need at the moment. In terms of Docker, a bridge network uses a software bridge which allows containers connected to the same bridge network to communicate, while providing isolation from containers which are not connected to that bridge network. The Docker bridge driver automatically installs rules in the host machine so that containers on different bridge networks cannot communicate directly with each other. There are other kinds of networks that you can create, and you are encouraged to read about them in the official docs.</p> <p>Now that we have a network, we can launch our containers inside this network using the <code>--net</code> flag. Let's do that - but first, in order to launch a new container with the same name, we will stop and remove our ES container that is running in the bridge (default) network.</p> <pre><code>$ docker container stop es\nes\n\n$ docker container rm es\nes\n\n$ docker run -d --name es --net foodtrucks-net -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e \"discovery.type=single-node\" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.3.2\n13d6415f73c8d88bddb1f236f584b63dbaf2c3051f09863a3f1ba219edba3673\n\n$ docker network inspect foodtrucks-net\n[\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"foodtrucks-net\",\n        \"Id\": \"0815b2a3bb7a6608e850d05553cc0bda98187c4528d94621438f31d97a6fea3c\",\n        \"Created\": \"2018-07-30T00:01:29.1500984Z\",\n        \"Scope\": \"local\",\n        \"Driver\": \"bridge\",\n        \"EnableIPv6\": false,\n        \"IPAM\": {\n            \"Driver\": \"default\",\n            \"Options\": {},\n            \"Config\": [\n                {\n                    \"Subnet\": \"172.18.0.0/16\",\n                    \"Gateway\": \"172.18.0.1\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        \"Internal\": false,\n        \"Attachable\": false,\n        \"Ingress\": false,\n        \"ConfigFrom\": {\n            \"Network\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"ConfigOnly\": false,\n        \"Containers\": {\n            \"13d6415f73c8d88bddb1f236f584b63dbaf2c3051f09863a3f1ba219edba3673\": {\n                \"Name\": \"es\",\n                \"EndpointID\": \"29ba2d33f9713e57eb6b38db41d656e4ee2c53e4a2f7cf636bdca0ec59cd3aa7\",\n                \"MacAddress\": \"02:42:ac:12:00:02\",\n                \"IPv4Address\": \"172.18.0.2/16\",\n                \"IPv6Address\": \"\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"Options\": {},\n        \"Labels\": {}\n    }\n]\n</code></pre> <p>As you can see, our <code>es</code> container is now running inside the <code>foodtrucks-net</code> bridge network.

In the Docker ecosystem, however, there are a bunch of other open-source tools which play very nicely with Docker. A few of them are -</p> <ol> <li>Docker Machine - Create Docker hosts on your computer, on cloud providers, and inside your own data center</li> <li>Docker Compose - A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.</li> <li>Docker Swarm - A native clustering solution for Docker</li> <li>Kubernetes - Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.</li> </ol> <p>In this section, we are going to look at one of these tools, Docker Compose, and see how it can make dealing with multi-container apps easier.</p> <p>The background story of Docker Compose is quite interesting. Roughly around January 2014, a company called OrchardUp launched a tool called Fig. The idea behind Fig was to make isolated development environments work with Docker. The project was very well received on Hacker News - I oddly remember reading about it but didn't quite get the hang of it.</p> <p>The first comment on the forum actually does a good job of explaining what Fig is all about.</p> <p>So really at this point, that's what Docker is about: running processes. Now Docker offers a quite rich API to run the processes: shared volumes (directories) between containers (i.e. running images), forward port from the host to the container, display logs, and so on. But that's it: Docker as of now, remains at the process level.</p> <p>While it provides options to orchestrate multiple containers to create a single \"app\", it doesn't address the management of such group of containers as a single entity. And that's where tools such as Fig come in: talking about a group of containers as a single entity. Think \"run an app\" (i.e. \"run an orchestrated cluster of containers\") instead of \"run a container\".</p> <p>It turns out that a lot of people using docker agree with this sentiment. Slowly and steadily as Fig became popular, Docker Inc. took notice, acquired the company and re-branded Fig as Docker Compose.</p> <p>So what is Compose used for? Compose is a tool that is used for defining and running multi-container Docker apps in an easy way. It provides a configuration file called <code>docker-compose.yml</code> that can be used to bring up an application and the suite of services it depends on with just one command. Compose works in all environments: production, staging, development, testing, as well as CI workflows, although Compose is ideal for development and testing environments.</p> <p>Let's see if we can create a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file for our SF-Foodtrucks app and evaluate whether Docker Compose lives up to its promise.</p> <p>The first step, however, is to install Docker Compose. If you're running Windows or Mac, Docker Compose is already installed as it comes in the Docker Toolbox. Linux users can easily get their hands on Docker Compose by following the instructions on the docs. Since Compose is written in Python, you can also simply do <code>pip install docker-compose</code>. Test your installation with -</p> <pre><code>$ docker-compose --version\ndocker-compose version 1.21.2, build a133471\n</code></pre> <p>Now that we have it installed, we can jump on the next step i.e. the Docker Compose file <code>docker-compose.yml</code>. The syntax for YAML is quite simple and the repo already contains the docker-compose file that we'll be using.</p> <pre><code>version: \"3\"\nservices:\n  es:\n    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.3.2\n    container_name: es\n    environment:\n      - discovery.type=single-node\n    ports:\n      - 9200:9200\n    volumes:\n      - esdata1:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data\n  web:\n    image: yourusername/foodtrucks-web\n    command: python3 app.py\n    depends_on:\n      - es\n    ports:\n      - 5000:5000\n    volumes:\n      - ./flask-app:/opt/flask-app\nvolumes:\n  esdata1:\n    driver: local\n</code></pre> <p>Let me breakdown what the file above means. At the parent level, we define the names of our services - <code>es</code> and <code>web</code>. The <code>image</code> parameter is always required, and for each service that we want Docker to run, we can add additional parameters. For <code>es</code>, we just refer to the <code>elasticsearch</code> image available on Elastic registry. For our Flask app, we refer to the image that we built at the beginning of this section.</p> <p>Other parameters such as <code>command</code> and <code>ports</code> provide more information about the container. The <code>volumes</code> parameter specifies a mount point in our <code>web</code> container where the code will reside. This is purely optional and is useful if you need access to logs, etc. We'll later see how this can be useful during development. Refer to the online reference to learn more about the parameters this file supports. We also add volumes for the <code>es</code> container so that the data we load persists between restarts. We also specify <code>depends_on</code>, which tells docker to start the <code>es</code> container before <code>web</code>. You can read more about it on docker compose docs.</p> <p>Note: You must be inside the directory with the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file in order to execute most Compose commands.</p> <p>Great! Now the file is ready, let's see <code>docker-compose</code> in action. But before we start, we need to make sure the ports and names are free.

As stated earlier, docker-compose is really great for development and testing. So let's see how we can configure compose to make our lives easier during development.</p> <p>Throughout this tutorial, we've worked with readymade docker images. While we've built images from scratch, we haven't touched any application code yet and mostly restricted ourselves to editing Dockerfiles and YAML configurations. One thing that you must be wondering is how does the workflow look during development? Is one supposed to keep creating Docker images for every change, then publish it and then run it to see if the changes work as expected? I'm sure that sounds super tedious. There has to be a better way. In this section, that's what we're going to explore.</p> <p>Let's see how we can make a change in the Foodtrucks app we just ran. Make sure you have the app running,</p> <pre><code>$ docker container ls\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                 COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                              NAMES\n5450ebedd03c        yourusername/foodtrucks-web                           \"python3 app.py\"         9 seconds ago       Up 6 seconds        0.0.0.0:5000-&gt;5000/tcp             foodtrucks_web_1\n05d408b25dfe        docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.3.2   \"/usr/local/bin/dock\u2026\"   10 hours ago        Up 10 hours         0.0.0.0:9200-&gt;9200/tcp, 9300/tcp   es\n</code></pre> <p>Now let's see if we can change this app to display a <code>Hello world!</code> message when a request is made to <code>/hello</code> route. Currently, the app responds with a 404.</p> <pre><code>$ curl -I 0.0.0.0:5000/hello\nHTTP/1.0 404 NOT FOUND\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 233\nServer: Werkzeug/0.11.2 Python/2.7.15rc1\nDate: Mon, 30 Jul 2018 15:34:38 GMT\n</code></pre> <p>Why does this happen? Since ours is a Flask app, we can see <code>app.py</code> (link) for answers. In Flask, routes are defined with @app.route syntax. In the file, you'll see that we only have three routes defined - <code>/</code>,<code>/debug</code>and<code>/search</code>. The<code>/</code>route renders the main app, the<code>debug</code>route is used to return some debug information and finally<code>search</code> is used by the app to query elasticsearch.</p> <pre><code>$ curl 0.0.0.0:5000/debug\n{\n  \"msg\": \"yellow open sfdata Ibkx7WYjSt-g8NZXOEtTMg 5 1 618 0 1.3mb 1.3mb\\n\",\n  \"status\": \"success\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Given that context, how would we add a new route for <code>hello</code>? You guessed it! Let's open <code>flask-app/app.py</code> in our favorite editor and make the following change</p> <pre><code>@app.route('/')\ndef index():\n  return render_template(\"index.html\")\n\n# add a new hello route\n@app.route('/hello')\ndef hello():\n  return \"hello world!\"\n</code></pre> <p>Now let's try making a request again</p> <pre><code>$ curl -I 0.0.0.0:5000/hello\nHTTP/1.0 404 NOT FOUND\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 233\nServer: Werkzeug/0.11.2 Python/2.7.15rc1\nDate: Mon, 30 Jul 2018 15:34:38 GMT\n</code></pre> <p>Oh no! That didn't work! What did we do wrong? While we did make the change in <code>app.py</code>, the file resides in our machine (or the host machine), but since Docker is running our containers based off the <code>yourusername/foodtrucks-web</code> image, it doesn't know about this change. To validate this, lets try the following -</p> <pre><code>$ docker-compose run web bash\nStarting es ... done\nroot@581e351c82b0:/opt/flask-app# ls\napp.py        package-lock.json  requirements.txt  templates\nnode_modules  package.json       static            webpack.config.js\nroot@581e351c82b0:/opt/flask-app# grep hello app.py\nroot@581e351c82b0:/opt/flask-app# exit\n</code></pre> <p>What we're trying to do here is to validate that our changes are not in the <code>app.py</code> that's running in the container. We do this by running the command <code>docker-compose run</code>, which is similar to its cousin <code>docker run</code> but takes additional arguments for the service (which is <code>web</code> in our case). As soon as we run <code>bash</code>, the shell opens in <code>/opt/flask-app</code> as specified in our Dockerfile. From the grep command we can see that our changes are not in the file.</p> <p>Lets see how we can fix it. First off, we need to tell docker compose to not use the image and instead use the files locally. We'll also set debug mode to <code>true</code> so that Flask knows to reload the server when <code>app.py</code> changes. Replace the <code>web</code> portion of the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file like so:</p> <pre><code>version: \"3\"\nservices:\n  es:\n    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.3.2\n    container_name: es\n    environment:\n      - discovery.type=single-node\n    ports:\n      - 9200:9200\n    volumes:\n      - esdata1:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data\n  web:\n    build: . # replaced image with build\n    command: python3 app.py\n    environment:\n      - DEBUG=True # set an env var for flask\n    depends_on:\n      - es\n    ports:\n      - \"5000:5000\"\n    volumes:\n      - ./flask-app:/opt/flask-app\nvolumes:\n  esdata1:\n    driver: local\n</code></pre> <p>With that change (diff), let's stop and start the containers.</p> <pre><code>$ docker-compose down -v\nStopping foodtrucks_web_1 ... done\nStopping es               ... done\nRemoving foodtrucks_web_1 ... done\nRemoving es               ... done\nRemoving network foodtrucks_default\nRemoving volume foodtrucks_esdata1\n\n$ docker-compose up -d\nCreating network \"foodtrucks_default\" with the default driver\nCreating volume \"foodtrucks_esdata1\" with local driver\nCreating es ... done\nCreating foodtrucks_web_1 ... done\n</code></pre> <p>As a final step, lets make the change in <code>app.py</code> by adding a new route. Now we try to curl</p> <pre><code>$ curl 0.0.0.0:5000/hello\nhello world\n</code></pre> <p>Wohoo! We get a valid response! Try playing around by making more changes in the app.</p> <p>That concludes our tour of Docker Compose. With Docker Compose, you can also pause your services, run a one-off command on a container and even scale the number of containers. I also recommend you checkout a few other use-cases of Docker compose. Hopefully, I was able to show you how easy it is to manage multi-container environments with Compose. In the final section, we are going to deploy our app to AWS!</p>"},{"location":"CTF/Docker/#aws-elastic-container-service","title":"AWS Elastic Container Service","text":"<p>In the last section we used <code>docker-compose</code> to run our app locally with a single command: <code>docker-compose up</code>. Now that we have a functioning app we want to share this with the world, get some users, make tons of money and buy a big house in Miami. Executing the last three are beyond the scope of the tutorial, so we'll spend our time instead on figuring out how we can deploy our multi-container apps on the cloud with AWS.</p> <p>If you've read this far you are pretty much convinced that Docker is a pretty cool technology. And you are not alone. Seeing the meteoric rise of Docker, almost all Cloud vendors started working on adding support for deploying Docker apps on their platform. As of today, you can deploy containers on Google Cloud Platform, AWS, Azure and many others. We already got a primer on deploying single container apps with Elastic Beanstalk and in this section we are going to look at Elastic Container Service (or ECS) by AWS.</p> <p>AWS ECS is a scalable and super flexible container management service that supports Docker containers. It allows you to operate a Docker cluster on top of EC2 instances via an easy-to-use API. Where Beanstalk came with reasonable defaults, ECS allows you to completely tune your environment as per your needs. This makes ECS, in my opinion, quite complex to get started with.</p> <p>Luckily for us, ECS has a friendly CLI tool that understands Docker Compose files and automatically provisions the cluster on ECS! Since we already have a functioning <code>docker-compose.yml</code> it should not take a lot of effort in getting up and running on AWS. So let's get started!</p> <p>The first step is to install the CLI. Instructions to install the CLI on both Mac and Linux are explained very clearly in the official docs. Go ahead, install the CLI and when you are done, verify the install by running</p> <pre><code>$ ecs-cli --version\necs-cli version 1.18.1 (7e9df84)\n</code></pre> <p>Next, we'll be working on configuring the CLI so that we can talk to ECS. We'll be following the steps as detailed in the official guide on AWS ECS docs. In case of any confusion, please feel free to refer to that guide.</p> <p>The first step will involve creating a profile that we'll use for the rest of the tutorial. To continue, you'll need your <code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code> and <code>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code>. To obtain these, follow the steps as detailed under the section titled Access Key and Secret Access Key on this page.</p> <pre><code>$ ecs-cli configure profile --profile-name ecs-foodtrucks --access-key $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID --secret-key $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\n</code></pre> <p>Next, we need to get a keypair which we'll be using to log into the instances. Head over to your EC2 Console and create a new keypair. Download the keypair and store it in a safe location. Another thing to note before you move away from this screen is the region name. In my case, I have named my key - <code>ecs</code> and set my region as <code>us-east-1</code>. This is what I'll assume for the rest of this walkthrough.</p> <p></p> <p>The next step is to configure the CLI.</p> <pre><code>$ ecs-cli configure --region us-east-1 --cluster foodtrucks\nINFO[0000] Saved ECS CLI configuration for cluster (foodtrucks)\n</code></pre> <p>We provide the <code>configure</code> command with the region name we want our cluster to reside in and a cluster name. Make sure you provide the same region name that you used when creating the keypair. If you've not configured the AWS CLI on your computer before, you can use the official guide, which explains everything in great detail on how to get everything going.</p> <p>The next step enables the CLI to create a CloudFormation template.</p> <pre><code>$ ecs-cli up --keypair ecs --capability-iam --size 1 --instance-type t2.medium\nINFO[0000] Using recommended Amazon Linux 2 AMI with ECS Agent 1.39.0 and Docker version 18.09.9-ce\nINFO[0000] Created cluster                               cluster=foodtrucks\nINFO[0001] Waiting for your cluster resources to be created\nINFO[0001] Cloudformation stack status                   stackStatus=CREATE_IN_PROGRESS\nINFO[0062] Cloudformation stack status                   stackStatus=CREATE_IN_PROGRESS\nINFO[0122] Cloudformation stack status                   stackStatus=CREATE_IN_PROGRESS\nINFO[0182] Cloudformation stack status                   stackStatus=CREATE_IN_PROGRESS\nINFO[0242] Cloudformation stack status                   stackStatus=CREATE_IN_PROGRESS\nVPC created: vpc-0bbed8536930053a6\nSecurity Group created: sg-0cf767fb4d01a3f99\nSubnet created: subnet-05de1db2cb1a50ab8\nSubnet created: subnet-01e1e8bc95d49d0fd\nCluster creation succeeded.\n</code></pre> <p>Here we provide the name of the keypair we downloaded initially (<code>ecs</code> in my case), the number of instances that we want to use (<code>--size</code>) and the type of instances that we want the containers to run on. The <code>--capability-iam</code> flag tells the CLI that we acknowledge that this command may create IAM resources.</p> <p>The last and final step is where we'll use our <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file. We'll need to make a few minor changes, so instead of modifying the original, let's make a copy of it. The contents of this file (after making the changes) look like (below) -</p> <pre><code>version: '2'\nservices:\n  es:\n    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.6.2\n    cpu_shares: 100\n    mem_limit: 3621440000\n    environment:\n      - discovery.type=single-node\n      - bootstrap.memory_lock=true\n      - \"ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m\"\n    logging:\n      driver: awslogs\n      options:\n        awslogs-group: foodtrucks\n        awslogs-region: us-east-1\n        awslogs-stream-prefix: es\n  web:\n    image: yourusername/foodtrucks-web\n    cpu_shares: 100\n    mem_limit: 262144000\n    ports:\n      - \"80:5000\"\n    links:\n      - es\n    logging:\n      driver: awslogs\n      options:\n        awslogs-group: foodtrucks\n        awslogs-region: us-east-1\n        awslogs-stream-prefix: web\n</code></pre> <p>The only changes we made from the original <code>docker-compose.yml</code> are of providing the <code>mem_limit</code> (in bytes) and <code>cpu_shares</code> values for each container and adding some logging configuration. This allows us to view logs generated by our containers in AWS CloudWatch. Head over to CloudWatch to create a log group called <code>foodtrucks</code>. Note that since ElasticSearch typically ends up taking more memory, we've given around 3.4 GB of memory limit. Another thing we need to do before we move onto the next step is to publish our image on Docker Hub.</p> <pre><code>$ docker push yourusername/foodtrucks-web\n</code></pre> <p>Great!

Likewise, when a <code>pop</code> instruction is executed, the value at <code>esp</code> is retrieved (i.e. <code>esp</code> is dereferenced), and <code>esp</code> is then incremented by 4 (or 8).</p> <p>N.B. The stack \"grows\" down to lower memory addresses!</p> <p>Conventionally, <code>ebp</code>/<code>rbp</code> contains the address of the top of the current stack frame, and so sometimes local variables are referenced as an offset relative to <code>ebp</code> rather than an offset to <code>esp</code>.

The earliest computers were designed with 8 bits (bit) as a byte (byte), so the largest integer that a byte can represent is 255 (binary 1111111111 = decimal 255), and to represent larger integers, more bytes must be used. For example, the largest integer that can be represented by two bytes is <code>65535</code> and the largest integer that can be represented by four bytes is <code>4294967295</code>.</p> <p>Since the computer was invented by the Americans, only 127 characters were first encoded into the computer, that is, upper and lower case English letters, numbers and some symbols, this code table is called <code>ASCII</code> code, for example, the code for upper case letter <code>A</code> is <code>65</code> and the code for lower case letter <code>z</code> is <code>122</code>.</p> <p>But to deal with Chinese, obviously, one byte is not enough, at least two bytes are needed, and it should not conflict with ASCII, so China has developed <code>GB2312</code> encoding, which is used to encode Chinese.</p> <p>As you can imagine, there are hundreds of languages in the world, Japan coded Japanese into <code>Shift_JIS</code>, Korea coded Korean into <code>Euc-kr</code>, and each country has its own standard, so there will be inevitable conflicts, and as a result, there will be garbled codes in the mixed text of multiple languages.</p> <p></p> <p>As a result, the Unicode character set was created. Unicode unifies all languages into one set of encodings so that there will be no more problems with garbled code.</p> <p>The Unicode standard has evolved, but the most commonly used is the UCS-16 encoding, which uses two bytes to represent a character (four bytes are needed if very remote characters are to be used). Unicode is directly supported by modern operating systems and most programming languages.</p> <p>Now, run through the differences between ASCII and Unicode encoding: ASCII encoding is 1 byte, while Unicode encoding is usually 2 bytes.</p> <p>The letter <code>A</code> is <code>65</code> in decimal and <code>01000001</code> in binary with ASCII encoding.</p> <p>The character <code>0</code> in ASCII encoding is <code>48</code> in decimal and <code>00110000</code> in binary, noting that the character <code>'0'</code> is different from the integer <code>0</code>.</p> <p>The Chinese character <code>\u4e2d</code> is beyond the scope of ASCII encoding and is <code>20013</code> in decimal and <code>01001110 00101101</code> in binary using Unicode encoding.</p> <p>You can guess that if you encode the ASCII-encoded <code>A</code> in Unicode, you just need to make up the 0 in front of it, so the Unicode encoding of <code>A</code> is <code>00000000 01000001</code>.</p> <p>A new problem arises again: if you unify it into Unicode, the messy code problem disappears from now on. However, if all the text you write is basically in English, Unicode encoding requires twice as much storage space as ASCII encoding, which is very uneconomical in terms of storage and transmission.</p> <p>Therefore, in the spirit of saving, <code>UTF-8</code> encoding, which converts Unicode encoding into <code>variable-length encoding</code>, has emerged.

The parameter with small changes can then be used as the default parameter.</p> <p>What are the benefits of using default parameters? The biggest benefit is that it reduces the difficulty of calling the function.</p> <p>For example, let's write a function to register a first grade student and pass in two parameters <code>name</code> and <code>gender</code>.</p> <pre><code>def enroll(name, gender):\n    print('name:', name)\n    print('gender:', gender)\n</code></pre> <p>In this way, the <code>enroll()</code> function is called with only two parameters passed in.</p> <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; enroll('Sarah', 'F')\nname: Sarah\ngender: F\n</code></pre> <p>What if I want to continue passing in information such as age, city, etc.? This would make calling the function much more complicated.</p> <p>We can set age and city as default parameters.</p> <pre><code>def enroll(name, gender, age=6, city='Beijing'):\n    print('name:', name)\n    print('gender:', gender)\n    print('age:', age)\n    print('city:', city)\n</code></pre> <p>In this way, most students are not required to provide their age and city when registering, but only the two required parameters.</p> <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; enroll('Sarah', 'F')\nname: Sarah\ngender: F\nage: 6\ncity: Beijing\n</code></pre> <p>Only students who do not match the default parameters will be required to provide additional information.</p> <pre><code>enroll('Bob', 'M', 7)\nenroll('Adam', 'M', city='Tianjin')\n</code></pre> <p>As you can see, the default arguments reduce the difficulty of function calls, and once more complex calls are needed, more arguments can be passed to achieve them. Whether it is a simple call or a complex call, the function only needs to define one.</p> <p>When there are multiple default parameters, the call can either provide the default parameters in order, such as calling <code>enroll('Bob', 'M', 7)</code>, meaning that, in addition to the two parameters <code>name</code>, <code>gender</code>, the last 1 parameter is applied to the parameter <code>age</code>, and the <code>city</code> parameter, since it is not provided, still uses the default value.</p> <p>It is also possible to provide partial default parameters out of order. When providing partial default parameters out of order, you need to put the parameter name on. For example, calling <code>enroll('Adam', 'M', city='Tianjin')</code> means that the <code>city</code> parameter uses the value passed in and the other default parameters continue to use the default values.</p> <p>Default parameters are useful, but they can fall into a hole if not used properly. The default parameters have one of the biggest pits, as demonstrated below.</p> <p>First define a function, pass in a list, add an <code>END</code> and then return.</p> <pre><code>def add_end(L=[]):\n    L.append('END')\n    return L\n</code></pre> <p>When you call it normally, the result seems good:</p> <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; add_end([1, 2, 3])\n[1, 2, 3, 'END']\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add_end(['x', 'y', 'z'])\n['x', 'y', 'z', 'END']\n</code></pre> <p>When you call with the default parameters, the result is also correct at first:</p> <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; add_end()\n['END']\n</code></pre> <p>However, when <code>add_end()</code> is called again, the result is not correct:</p> <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; add_end()\n['END', 'END']\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add_end()\n['END', 'END', 'END']\n</code></pre> <p>Many beginners are puzzled by the fact that the default argument is <code>[]</code>, but the function seems to \"remember\" the list after adding <code>'END'</code> each time.</p> <p>The reason for this is as follows.</p> <p>When a Python function is defined, the value of the default parameter <code>L</code> is calculated, i.e. <code>[]</code>, because the default parameter <code>L</code> is also a variable that points to the object <code>[]</code>, and each time the function is called, if the content of <code>L</code> is changed, the content of the default parameter will change the next time it is called, and will no longer be the <code>[]</code> of the function when it is defined.</p> <p>One thing to keep in mind when defining default parameters: they must point to invariant objects!</p> <p>To modify the above example, we can use the invariant object <code>None</code> to implement.</p> <pre><code>def add_end(L=None):\n    if L is None:\n        L = []\n    L.append('END')\n    return L\n</code></pre> <p>Now, no matter how many times it is called, there will be no problem:</p> <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; add_end()\n['END']\n&gt;&gt;&gt; add_end()\n['END']\n</code></pre> <p>Why do we design invariant objects like <code>str</code> and <code>None</code>? Because once the invariant object is created, the data inside the object cannot be modified, which reduces the errors caused by modifying the data. In addition, because the object is invariant, there is no need to add locks to read the object simultaneously in a multitasking environment, and there is no problem reading it simultaneously at all. When we write a program, if we can design an invariant object, then try to design it as invariant object.</p>"},{"location":"CTF/Python_3/#variable-arguments","title":"Variable arguments","text":"<p>Variable parameters can also be defined in Python functions.

Unfortunately, so far I have only completed the outline and part of the first chapter of the book, and I hope to continue this work in 2023.</p> </li> <li> <p>Competition planning for new members: This is one of the main tasks of the varsity team, and despite our intensive weekly training, the number of members participating in competitions is still very insufficient. In the weekly meetings, I synchronize the competitions that will be held soon, but few new members intend to participate.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adjustment of the tournament platform: Unfortunately, although I had planned to adjust the topics and functions of the CTFd platform being used and made some rough proposals, this plan did not come to fruition in the end. After testing the new platform on 2023-01-07, I decided to use GZCTF as our new platform and abandon the original CTFd platform. I will transfer our original questions, entry test questions, and other high-quality tournament questions to GZCTF.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cooperation with the Information Center: At the beginning of the establishment of the varsity team, I communicated quite closely with a colleague from the Information Center ITS, would participate in each other's activities, and achieved some results in the construction of the network security. Unfortunately, after several lengthy and boring communications, annoying network problems, and a change in the attitude of the Information Center towards cyber security, ITS did not participate in many of the subsequent events we held. I regret that COMPASS TEAM's attempts to work with the Information Center to improve campus cybersecurity have largely failed, but I will still try to convince ITS to pursue this effort.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Meeting/CTF%20Week%20Meeting%202023-01-12/#0x4-the-2023-year-plan","title":"0x4.

I will migrate the basic content training online, and invite the whole school to attend a 3-week basic content training and lecture, after which a recruitment/in-school competition will be held to decide on new members.</p> <p>The number of new members recruited this semester will be about 5.</p> <p>Basic content training will be posted on a wiki and linked to online archiving platforms (e.g. social accounts or catechism sites), and sections on basic content include.</p> <ol> <li>introduction to CTF basic content and future directions.</li> <li>the spirit of network security and how to search for information.</li> <li>how to install and use Linux systems.</li> <li>basic program development using Python.</li> <li>Data forensics and information steganography.</li> <li>Data encoding and cryptographic security.</li> <li>Network attack and defense and website penetration testing.</li> <li>Assembly code basics and reverse engineering.</li> <li>Binary Security Fundamentals.</li> </ol> <p>Additional information on the foundation content is provided in part as follows.</p> <ol> <li>Introduction to HTML/CSS/JavaScript basics.</li> <li>PHP code fundamentals.</li> <li>Program debugging using GDB and plug-ins.</li> <li>Docker containers and Kubernetes for container management.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"Meeting/CTF%20Week%20Meeting%202023-03-02/#0x4-ctf-from-practice-to-principle","title":"0x4. CTF from Practice to Principle","text":"<p>The idea to write the book \"CTF: From Practice to Principle\" is inspired by my professor Fengwei, Zhang. From all of my personal experience with the CTF challenges and the events, there's always a huge gap between the beginner layer introduction to the advanced layer expert. When I start to step out of the beginner layer, it's very difficult to understand how and why some advanced knowledge.</p> <p>Under the thought of this aspect of the difficulty, I want to introduce those things you won't know when first solved some challenges. Each chapter of the book would start with some practice knowledge, and end with some difficult advanced principles. The whole book would be divided into two parts: basic knowledge that you can learn from simply reading and learning some limited necessary knowledge, and the hard part is that you need to read more about the principle, source code, and the details of the techniques.</p> <p>Being restricted by my skills, some parts of the book would refer to online websites, technical books, and research papers. I would carefully note the reference when I use them, and if that reference has violated the terms of usage, please contact me and I would delete those parts immediately. Besides, related apologies and compensation would be discussed.</p> <p>**Example reference format: **</p> <p>One of the common tools for web directory scanning is <code>dirbuster</code>[1]. According to ...</p> <p>[1] dirbuster: https://www.kali.org/tools/dirbuster/ Kali dirbuster description page, https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/dirbuster GitLab dirbuster source code page</p> <p>The writing of the book is done by my limited experience and the architecture of knowledge. The mistakes and the errors are not avoidable. If you find any of them, please feel free to contact me, very glad to have your advice. By the way, I would like to send some presents (stickers, T-shirts, or other little things) in return. Luckily, we have an online page to host the book during my writing progress. It's also fine to use GitHub's pull request to correct any mistake.</p> <p>Enough for the book writing, now let's talk about the structure of the book in the next chapter.</p>"},{"location":"Meeting/CTF%20Week%20Meeting%202023-03-02/#0x5-national-college-student-information-security-contest","title":"0x5.

A freshman in the university is less experienced compared with the senior students, but from future learning, a freshman can have more time to improve. The weight is in order to balance the grades.</p> <ul> <li>Freshman (grade 1): +6%.</li> <li>Sophomore (grade 2): +4%.</li> <li>Junior (grade 3): +2%.</li> </ul> <p>This is summer training, and we won't have any senior members (they are already graduated).</p> <p>For example, if you got 3127 in the challenges and competitions, 155 in the remarks, 229 in the report, and 1625 in the final exam. You are a freshman in the university and just finished your first year. The total score would be: <code>1.06 * (0.3 * 11.610563503925041 + 0.1 * 7.2761244052742375 + 0.15 * 7.839203788096944 + 1 * 10.66622400280318) = 17.016059226486018</code>.</p>"},{"location":"Meeting/2022%20First%20Half/CTF%20Week%20Meeting%202022-06-09/#upcoming-events","title":"Upcoming events","text":""},{"location":"Meeting/2022%20First%20Half/CTF%20Week%20Meeting%202022-06-09/#_1","title":"\u5f3a\u56fd\u676f","text":"<p>https://www.qiangguobei.org.cn/</p> <p>https://www.qiangguobei.org.cn/index/match/detail/id/12.html</p> <p>Register: starts from 2022-06-08</p> <p>Online Jeopardy: 2022-07-06</p> <p>Online region challenges: 2022-07-24 (TBA)</p> <p>Offline final: 2022-08-31 (TBA)</p>"},{"location":"Meeting/2022%20First%20Half/CTF%20Week%20Meeting%202022-06-09/#_2","title":"\u7f51\u9f0e\u676f","text":"<p>https://www.wangdingcup.com/</p>"},{"location":"Meeting/2022%20First%20Half/CTF%20Week%20Meeting%202022-06-09/#_3","title":"\u5b98\u65b9\u8d44\u683c\u8d5b\u7ebf\u4e0a\u62a5\u540d","text":"<p>6\u67082\u65e510:00-7\u670827\u65e520:00</p>"},{"location":"Meeting/2022%20First%20Half/CTF%20Week%20Meeting%202022-06-09/#_4","title":"\u5b98\u65b9\u8d44\u683c\u8d5b\uff08\u9752\u9f99\u7ec4\uff09","text":"<p>\u53c2\u8d5b\u884c\u4e1a\uff1a\u9ad8\u7b49\u9662\u6821\uff0c\u804c\u4e1a\u9662\u6821\uff0c\u65e0\u5355\u4f4d\u6302\u9760\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u53c2\u8d5b\u961f\u4f0d</p> <p>8\u67084\u65e59:00-17:00</p>"},{"location":"Meeting/2022%20First%20Half/CTF%20Week%20Meeting%202022-06-09/#_5","title":"\u5b98\u65b9\u8d44\u683c\u8d5b\uff08\u7384\u6b66\u7ec4\uff09","text":"<p>\u53c2\u8d5b\u884c\u4e1a\uff1a\u79d1\u7814\u673a\u6784\u3001\u79d1\u6280\u4f01\u4e1a\u3001\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u4f01\u4e1a\u3001\u7f51\u5b89\u4f01\u4e1a</p> <p>8\u67089\u65e59:00-17:00</p>"},{"location":"Meeting/2022%20First%20Half/CTF%20Week%20Meeting%202022-06-09/#_6","title":"\u534a\u51b3\u8d5b","text":"<p>8\u670828\u65e5</p>"},{"location":"Meeting/2022%20First%20Half/CTF%20Week%20Meeting%202022-06-09/#_7","title":"\u603b\u51b3\u8d5b","text":"<p>8\u670829\u65e5</p>"},{"location":"Meeting/2022%20First%20Half/CTF%20Week%20Meeting%202022-06-09/#note","title":"Note","text":"<ul> <li>[x] \u6691\u671f\u8ba1\u5212\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6587\u6863\u6574\u7406\u4e0e\u60c5\u62a5\u6536\u96c6</li> <li>[ ] \u4e0b\u5b66\u671fCS315\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u4fee\u6539</li> <li>[ ] \u5e74\u5e95\u4f1a\u8bae\u6709\u5173\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5b89\u5168\u8bfe\u7a0b&amp;CTF\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u603b\u7ed3</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Meeting/2022%20First%20Half/CTF%20Week%20Meeting%202022-06-16/","title":"CTF Week Meeting 2022-06-16","text":"<ol> <li>Upgrades in CTFtime rank.</li> <li>Introduction to this weekend.</li> <li>Upcoming events.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"Meeting/2022%20First%20Half/CTF%20Week%20Meeting%202022-06-16/#ctftime-rank","title":"CTFtime rank","text":"<p>Just got HSCTF9 #79, and the CTFtime team rank goes to the #28 in China.</p>"},{"location":"Meeting/2022%20First%20Half/CTF%20Week%20Meeting%202022-06-16/#participated-in-ctf-events","title":"Participated in CTF events","text":"<ul> <li>2022</li> <li>2021</li> </ul> <p>Overall rating place: 473 with 41.261 pts in 2022</p> <p>Country place: 28</p> Place Event CTF points Rating points 79 HSCTF 9 3351.0000 9.690 104 1337UP LIVE CTF 1629.0000 3.547 31 Engineer CTF 5229.0000 12.184 27 Codegate CTF 2022 Preliminary 1802.0000 5.842 194 DefCamp CTF 21-22 Online 100.0000 1.061 159 Real World CTF 4th 32.0000 0.748 140 KnightCTF 2022 2425.0000 8.190"},{"location":"Meeting/2022%20First%20Half/CTF%20Week%20Meeting%202022-06-16/#introduction-to-this-weekend","title":"Introduction to this weekend","text":"<p>We are going to have our first summer training!</p> <p>Training time: June, 19th from 9:00 am to 18:00 pm</p> <p>Location: 551 Meeting Room, Southern Tower of the Engineering Department &amp; Online</p> <p>Topic: CTF Overview &amp; Fun-oriented challenges.</p>"},{"location":"Meeting/2022%20First%20Half/CTF%20Week%20Meeting%202022-06-16/#what-we-are-going-to-do","title":"What we are going to do","text":"<p>This week, we would register all members who want to participate in our summer schedule.

A plethora of work has been proposed to certify the robustness of feed-forward networks, e.g., FCNs and CNNs. Yet, most existing methods cannot be directly applied to recurrent neural networks (RNNs), due to their sequential inputs and unique operations. In this paper, we present Cert-RNN, a general framework for certifying the robustness of RNNs. Specifically, through detailed analysis for the intrinsic property of the unique function in different ranges, we exhaustively discuss different cases for the exact formula of bounding planes, based on which we design several precise and efficient abstract transformers for the unique calculations in RNNs. Cert-RNN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods (e.g., POPQORN [25]) in terms of (i) effectiveness \u2013 it provides much tighter robustness bounds, and (ii) efficiency \u2013 it scales to much more complex models. Through extensive evaluation, we validate Cert-RNN\u2019s superior performance across various network architectures (e.g., vanilla RNN and LSTM) and applications (e.g., image classification, sentiment analysis, toxic comment detection, and malicious URL detection). For instance, for the RNN-2-32 model on the MNIST sequence dataset, the robustness bound certified by Cert-RNN is on average 1.86 times larger than that by POPQORN. Besides certifying the robustness of given RNNs, Cert-RNN also enables a range of practical applications including evaluating the provable effectiveness for various defenses (i.e., the defense with a larger robustness region is considered to be more robust), improving the robustness of RNNs (i.e., incorporating Cert-RNN with verified robust training) and identifying sensitive words (i.e., the word with the smallest certified robustness bound is considered to be the most sensitive word in a sentence), which helps build more robust and interpretable deep learning systems. We will open-source CertRNN for facilitating the DNN security research.</p>"},{"location":"Paper/Artificial%20Intelligence/Cert-RNN%20Towards%20Certifying%20the%20Robustness%20of%20Recurrent/#related","title":"Related","text":"<p>Present PPT: https://nesa.zju.edu.cn/download/ppt/dty_slides_Cert-RNN.pdf</p>"},{"location":"Paper/Artificial%20Intelligence/Cert-RNN%20Towards%20Certifying%20the%20Robustness%20of%20Recurrent/#download","title":"Download","text":"<p>PDF: Cert-RNN Towards Certifying the Robustness of Recurrent.pdf</p>"},{"location":"Paper/Artificial%20Intelligence/Unleashing%20the%20Tiger%20Inference%20Attacks%20on%20Split%20Learning/","title":"Unleashing the Tiger Inference Attacks on Split Learning","text":"<p>[Submitted on 4 Dec 2020 (v1), last revised 21 Aug 2021 (this version, v4)]</p> <p>Authors: Dario Pasquini, Giuseppe Ateniese, Massimo Bernaschi</p> <p>Comments: To appear in the proceedings of: ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security 2021 (CCS21)</p> <p>Subjects: Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Machine Learning (cs.LG)</p>"},{"location":"Paper/Artificial%20Intelligence/Unleashing%20the%20Tiger%20Inference%20Attacks%20on%20Split%20Learning/#abstract","title":"Abstract","text":"<p>We investigate the security of Split Learning -- a novel collaborative machine learning framework that enables peak performance by requiring minimal resources consumption.

Due to the difficulty of obtaining and emulating IoT firmware, the black-box fuzzing of IoT devices has become a viable option. However, existing black-box fuzzers cannot form effective mutation optimization mechanisms to guide their testing processes, mainly due to the lack of feedback. It is difficult or even impossible to apply existing grammar-based fuzzing strategies. Therefore, an efficient fuzzing approach with syntax inference is required in the IoT fuzzing domain. To address these critical problems, we propose a novel automatic black-box fuzzing for IoT firmware, termed Snipuzz. Snipuzz runs as a client communicating with the devices and infers message snippets for mutation based on the responses. Each snippet refers to a block of consecutive bytes that reflect the approximate code coverage in fuzzing. This mutation strategy based on message snippets considerably narrows down the search space to change the probing messages. We compared Snipuzz with four state-of-the-art IoT fuzzing approaches, i.e., IoTFuzzer, BooFuzz, Doona, and Nemesys. Snipuzz not only inherits the advantages of app-based fuzzing (e.g., IoTFuzzer, but also utilizes communication responses to perform efficient mutation. Furthermore, Snipuzz is lightweight as its execution does not rely on any prerequisite operations, such as reverse engineering of apps. We also evaluated Snipuzz on 20 popular real-world IoT devices. Our results show that Snipuzz could identify 5 zero-day vulnerabilities, and 3 of them could be exposed only by Snipuzz. All the newly discovered vulnerabilities have been confirmed by their vendors.</p>"},{"location":"Paper/Internet%20of%20Things/Snipuzz%20Black-box%20Fuzzing%20of%20IoT%20Firmware%20via%20Message%20Snippet%20Inference/#download","title":"Download","text":"<p>PDF: Snipuzz Black-box Fuzzing of IoT Firmware via Message Snippet Inference.pdf</p>"},{"location":"Paper/Misc/Chaff%20Bugs%20Deterring%20Attackers%20by%20Making%20Software%20Buggier/","title":"Chaff Bugs: Deterring Attackers by Making Software Buggier","text":"<p>[Submitted on 2 Aug 2018]</p> <p>Authors: Zhenghao Hu, Yu Hu, Brendan Dolan-Gavitt</p> <p>Subjects: Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)</p>"},{"location":"Paper/Misc/Chaff%20Bugs%20Deterring%20Attackers%20by%20Making%20Software%20Buggier/#abstract","title":"Abstract","text":"<p>Sophisticated attackers find bugs in software, evaluate their exploitability, and then create and launch exploits for bugs found to be exploitable.

In this paper, we introduce a new defensive technique called chaff bugs, which instead target the bug discovery and exploit creation stages of this process. Rather than eliminating bugs, we instead add large numbers of bugs that are provably (but not obviously) non-exploitable. Attackers who attempt to find and exploit bugs in software will, with high probability, find an intentionally placed non-exploitable bug and waste precious resources in trying to build a working exploit. We develop two strategies for ensuring non-exploitability and use them to automatically add thousands of non-exploitable bugs to real-world software such as nginx and libFLAC; we show that the functionality of the software is not harmed and demonstrate that our bugs look exploitable to current triage tools.

Automated techniques have been proposed to analyze apps\u2019 privacy policies and their execution behavior, but they often overlooked the purposes of the apps\u2019 data collection, use and sharing. To mitigate this oversight, we propose PurPliance, an automated system that detects the inconsistencies between the data-usage purposes stated in a natural language privacy policy and those of the actual execution behavior of an Android app. PurPliance analyzes the predicate-argument structure of policy sentences and classifies the extracted purpose clauses into a taxonomy of data purposes. Purposes of actual data usage are inferred from network data traffic. We propose a formal model to represent and verify the data usage purposes in the extracted privacy statements and data flows to detect policy contradictions in a privacy policy and flow-to-policy inconsistencies between network data flows and privacy statements. Our evaluation results of end-to-end contradiction detection have shown PurPliance to improve detection precision from 19% to 95% and recall from 10% to 50% compared to a state-of-the-art method.

Bochs was originally written by Kevin Lawton and is currently maintained by this project.   Bochs can be compiled and used in a variety of modes, some which are still in development. The 'typical' use of bochs is to provide complete x86 PC emulation, including the x86 processor, hardware devices, and memory. This allows you to run OS's and software within the emulator on your workstation, much like you have a machine inside of a machine. For instance, let's say your workstation is a Unix/X11 workstation, but you want to run Win'95 applications.

Unfortunately, those signatures scan only bytes by the pre-set mask, and it is not possible to specify additional parameters. As the result, false triggering often occur. More complicated algorithms are usually strictly set in the program itself. Hence, to add a new complex detect one needs to recompile the entire project. No one, except the authors themselves, can change the algorithm of a detect. As time passes, such programs lose relevance without the constant support.</p> <p>Detect It Easy has totally open architecture of signatures. You can easily add your own algorithms of detects or modify those that already exist. This is achieved by using scripts. The script language is very similar to JavaScript and any person, who understands the basics of programming, will understand easily how it works. Possibly, someone may decide the scripts are working very slow. Indeed, scripts run slower than compiled code, but, thanks to the good optimization of Script Engine, this doesn't cause any special inconvenience. The possibilities of open architecture compensate these limitations.</p> <p>DIE exists in three versions. Basic version (\"DIE\"), Lite version (\"DIEL\") and console version (\"DIEC\"). All the three use the same signatures, which are located in the folder \"db\". If you open this folder, nested sub-folders will be found (\"Binary\", \"PE\" and others). The names of sub-folders correspond to the types of files. First, DIE determines the type of file, and then sequentially loads all the signatures, which lie in the corresponding folder.

This is NOT an attack on Python or Java as in a prior life I worked with Java primarily in Android Development and currently use Python in my professional environment. In today\u2019s Agile environment, rapid-development is reality. With the increased challenges in both the commercial market and the government sector, software development will continue to focus on more robust libraries that will do more with less.</p> <p>As a Senior Software Engineer in Test, I try to help as many people as possible bridge their skill-set with either an entry-point or career advancement into the job market. One thing that is critical to understand is that there is and will continue to be a dramatic shortage of engineers and developers of all shapes and sizes.</p> <p>Like it or not, hardware is getting smaller and smaller and the trend is going from CISC to RISC. A CISC is your typical x86 computer with a complex series of instructions. CISC computers will always exist however with the trend going toward cloud computing and the fact that RISC machines with a reduced instruction set are so enormously powerful today, they are the obvious choice for consumption.</p> <p>How many cell phones do you think exist on earth today? Most of them are RISC machines. How many of you have a Smart TV or Amazon Echo or any number of devices considered part of the IoT or Internet Of Things? Each of these devices have one thing in common \u2013 they are RISC and all are primarily ARM based.</p> <p>ARM is an advanced RISC machine. Compared to the very complex architecture of a CISC, most ARM systems today are what is referred to as a SoC or system on chip which is an integrated circuit which has all of the components of a computer and electronic system on a single chip. This includes RF functionality as well. These low-power embedded devices can run versions of Windows, Linux and many other advanced operating systems.</p> <p>\u201cWell who cares about ARM, you can call it anything you want, I know Python or Java and that\u2019s all I need to know cause when I program it works everywhere so I don\u2019t have to worry about anything under the hood.\u201d</p> <p>I again just want you to reflect on the above statement for a brief moment. As every day continues to pass, more and more systems are becoming vulnerable to attack and compromise. Taking the time to understand what is going on under the hood can only help to curb this unfortunate reality.</p> <p>This series will focus on ARM Assembly. We will work with a Raspberry Pi 3 which contains the Broadcom BCM2837 SoC with a 4x ARM Cortex-A53, 1.2GHz CPU and 1 GB LPDDR2 RAM. We will work with the Raspbian Jessie, Linux-based operating system. If you don\u2019t own a Raspberry Pi 3, they are usually available for $35 on Amazon or any number of retailers. If you would like to learn more visit https://www.raspberrypi.org.</p> <p>We will work solely in the terminal so no pretty pictures and graphics as we are keeping it to the hardcore bare-bones utilizing the GNU toolkit to compile and debug our code base.</p> <p>UNDER NO CONDITIONS ARE YOU TO EVER USE THIS EDUCATION TO CAUSE HARM TO ANY SYSTEM OF ANY KIND AS I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE!

Let\u2019s consider the example of the decimal value of 120 which is 0111 1000 binary.</p> <pre><code>128    64    32    16    8    4    2    1\n\n0      1     1     1     1    0    0    0\n</code></pre> <p>1)Can 128 fit inside of 120: No, therefore 0.</p> <p>2)Can 64 fit inside of 120: Yes, therefore 1, then 120 \u2013 64 = 56.</p> <p>3)Can 32 fit inside of 56: Yes, therefore 1, then 56 \u2013 32 = 24.</p> <p>4)Can 16 fit inside of 24: Yes, therefore 1, then 24 \u2013 16 = 8.</p> <p>5)Can 8 fit inside of 8: Yes, therefore 1, then 8 \u2013 8 = 0.</p> <p>6)Can 4 fit inside of 0: No, therefore 0.</p> <p>7)Can 2 fit inside of 0: No, therefore 0.</p> <p>8)Can 1 fit inside of 0: No, therefore 0.</p> <p>When we want to convert binary to hex we simply work with the following table.</p> <pre><code>Decimal    Hex    Binary\n\n0          0      0000\n\n1          1      0001\n\n2          2      0010\n\n3          3      0011\n\n4          4      0100\n\n5          5      0101\n\n6          6      0110\n\n7          7      0111\n\n8          8      1000\n\n9          9      1001\n\n10         A      1010\n\n11         B      1011\n\n12         C      1100\n\n13         D      1101\n\n14         E      1110\n\n15         F      1111\n</code></pre> <p>Lets convert a binary number such as 0101 1111 to hex. To do this we very simply look at the table and compare each nibble which is a combination of 4 bits. Keep in mind, 8 bits is equal to a byte and 2 nibbles are equal to a byte.</p> <pre><code>0101 = 5\n\n1111 = F\n</code></pre> <p>Therefore 0101 1111 binary = 0x5f hex.

You will NEVER get a grasp on how the ARM processor deals with a binary overflow and it\u2019s effect on how carry operations work nor will you understand how compare operations work or even the most basic operations of the most simple assembly code.</p> <p>I am not suggesting you memorize the above, nor am I suggesting that you do a thousand examples of each. All I ask is that you take the time to really understand that literally everything and I mean everything goes down to binary bits in the processor.</p> <p>Whether you are creating, debugging or hacking an Assembly, Python, Java, C, C++, R, JavaScript, or any other new language application that hits the street, ultimately everything MUST go down to binary 0 and 1 to which represent a +5V or 0V.</p> <p>We as humans operate on the base 10 decimal system. The processor works on a base 16 (hex) system. The registers we are dealing with in conjunction with Linux are addressed in 32-bit sizes. When we begin discussion of the processor registers, we will learn that each are 32-bits wide (technically the BCM2837 are 64-bit wide however our version of Linux that we are working with is 32-bit therefore we only address 32-bits of each register).</p>"},{"location":"Training/Material/ARM32_1/#part-3-binary-addition","title":"Part 3 \u2013 Binary Addition","text":"<p>Binary addition can occur in one of four different fashions:</p> <pre><code>0 + 0 = 0\n\n1 + 0 = 1\n\n0 + 1 = 1\n\n1 + 1 = 0 (1) [One Plus One Equals Zero, Carry One]\n</code></pre> <p>Keep in mind the (1) means a carry bit.

The ROM reads from the SD card and reads bootcode.bin to which gets loaded into memory in C2 cache and turns on the rest of the RAM to which start.elf then loads.</p> <p>The start.elf is an OS for the graphics processor and reads config.txt to which you can mod. The kernel.img then gets loaded into 0x8000 in memory which is the Linux kernel.</p> <p>Once loaded, kernel.img turns on the CPU and starts running at 0x8000 in memory.</p> <p>If we wanted, we could create our own kernel.img to which we can hard code machine code into a file and replace the original image and then reboot. Keep in mind the ARM word size is 32 bit long which go from bit 0 to 31.</p> <p>As stated, when kernel.img is loaded the first byte, which is 8-bits, is loaded into address 0x8000.</p> <p>Lets open up a hex editor and write the following:</p> <p>FE FF FF EA</p> <p>Save the file as kernel.img and reboot.</p> <p>\u201cOk nothing happens, this sucks!\u201d</p> <p>Actually something did happen, you created your first bare-metal firmware! Time to break out the champagne!</p> <p>When the Pi boots, the below code when it reached kernel.img loads the following:</p> <p>FE FF FF EA</p> <p>@ address 0x8000, 0xfe gets loaded.</p> <p>@ address 0x8001, 0xff gets loaded.</p> <p>@ address 0x8002, 0xff gets loaded.</p> <p>@ address 0x8003, 0xea gets loaded.</p> <p>\u201cSo what the hell is really going on?\u201d</p> <p>This set of commands simply executes an infinite loop.</p> <p>Review the datasheet:</p> <p>https://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf</p> <p>The above code has 3 parts to it:</p> <p>1)Conditional \u2013 Set To Always</p> <p>2)Op Code \u2013 Branch</p> <p>3)Offset \u2013 How Far To Move Within The Current Location</p> <p>Condition \u2013 bits 31-28: 0xe or 1110</p> <p>Op Code \u2013 bits 27-24: 0xa or 1010</p> <p>Offset \u2013 bits 23-0 -2</p> <p>I know this may be a lot to wrap your mind around however it is critical that you take the time and read the datasheet linked above. Do not cut corners if you truly have the passion to understand the above. READ THE DATASHEET!</p> <p>I will go through painstaking efforts to break everything down step-by-step however there are exercises like the above that I am asking you to review the datasheet above so you learn how to better understand where to look when you are stuck on a particular routine or set of machine code. This is one of those times I ask you to please read and research the datasheet above!</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m bored! Why the hell does this crap matter?\u201d</p> <p>Glad you asked! The single most dangerous malware on planet earth today is that of the root-kit variety. If you do not have a basic understanding of the above, you will never begin to even understand what a root-kit is as you progress in your understanding.</p> <p>Anyone can simply replace the kernel.img file with their own hacked version and you can have total control over the entire process from boot.</p>"},{"location":"Training/Material/ARM32_1/#part-12-von-neumann-architecture","title":"Part 12 - Von Neumann Architecture","text":"<p>ARM is a load and store machine to which the Arithmetic Logic Unit only operates on the registers themselves and any data that needs to be stored out to RAM, the control unit moves the data between memory and the registers which share the same data bus.</p> <p></p> <p>Program memory and data memory share the same data bus.

<p>Binary Exploitation is about finding vulnerabilities in programs and utilizing them to do what you wish. Sometimes this can result in an authentication bypass or the leaking of classified information, but occasionally (if you're lucky) it can also result in Remote Code Execution (RCE). The most basic forms of binary exploitation occur on the stack, a region of memory that stores temporary variables created by functions in code.</p> <p>When a new function is called, a memory address in the calling function is pushed to the stack - this way, the program knows where to return to once the called function finishes execution. Let's look at a basic binary to show this.</p> <p>introduction.zip</p>"},{"location":"Training/Material/pwn-stack-1/#analysis","title":"Analysis","text":"<p>The binary has two files - <code>source.c</code> and <code>vuln</code>; the latter is an <code>ELF</code> file, which is the executable format for Linux (it is recommended to follow along with this with a Virtual Machine of your own, preferably Linux).</p> <p>We're gonna use a tool called <code>radare2</code> to analyze the behavior of the binary when functions are called.</p> <pre><code>$ r2 -d -A vuln\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>-d</code> runs it while the <code>-A</code> performs the analysis.

First, let's disassemble <code>unsafe</code> and break on the <code>ret</code> instruction; <code>ret</code> is the equivalent of <code>pop eip</code>, which will get the saved return pointer we just analyzed on the stack into the <code>eip</code> register. Then let's continue and spam a bunch of characters into the input and see how that could affect it.</p> <pre><code>[0x08049172]&gt; db 0x080491aa\n[0x08049172]&gt; dc\nOverflow me\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n</code></pre> <p>Now let's read the value at the location the return pointer was at previously, which as we saw was <code>0xff984aec</code>.</p> <pre><code>[0x080491aa]&gt; pxw @ 0xff984aec\n0xff984aec  0x41414141 0x41414141 0x41414141 0x41414141  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n</code></pre> <p>Huh?</p> <p>It's quite simple - we inputted more data than the program expected, which resulted in us overwriting more of the stack than the developer expected. The saved return pointer is also on the stack, meaning we managed to overwrite it. As a result, on the <code>ret</code>, the value popped into <code>eip</code> won't be in the previous function but rather <code>0x41414141</code>. Let's check with <code>ds</code>.</p> <pre><code>[0x080491aa]&gt; ds\n[0x41414141]&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>And look at the new prompt - <code>0x41414141</code>.

If you cause the program to crash outside of a debugger, it will usually say <code>Segmentation Fault</code>, which could mean a variety of things, but usually that you have overwritten EIP.</p> <p>Of course, you can prevent people from writing more characters than expected when making your program, usually using other C functions such as <code>fgets()</code>; <code>gets()</code> is intrinsically unsafe because it doesn't check the length of the input, meaning that the presence of <code>gets()</code> is always something you should check out in a program. It is also possible to give <code>fgets()</code> the wrong parameters, meaning it still takes in too many characters.</p>"},{"location":"Training/Material/pwn-stack-1/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>When a function calls another function, it</p> <ul> <li>pushes a return pointer to the stack so the called function knows where to return</li> <li>when the called function finishes execution, it pops it off the stack again</li> </ul> <p>Because this value is saved on the stack, just like our local variables, if we write more characters than the program expects, we can overwrite the value and redirect code execution to wherever we wish.

Dynamically linked binaries are more common than statically linked binary in CTFs. The purpose of dynamic linking is that binaries do not have to carry all the code necessary to run within them - this reduces their size substantially. Instead, they rely on system libraries (especially <code>libc</code>, the C standard library) to provide the bulk of the functionality. For example, each ELF file will not carry its own version of <code>puts</code> compiled within it - it will instead dynamically link to the <code>puts</code> of the system it is on. As well as smaller binary sizes, this also means the user can continually upgrade their libraries, instead of having to redownload all the binaries every time a new version comes out.</p> <p>So when it's on a new system, it replaces function calls with hardcoded addresses?</p> <p>Not quite.</p> <p>The problem with this approach is it requires <code>libc</code> to have a constant base address, i.e. be loaded in the same area of memory every time it's run, but remember that *ASLR* exists.

The schedule we\u2019ve meticulously curated evolves seamlessly from didactic symposiums to hands-on, combative scenarios, guaranteeing that our assemblage is not merely conversant with avant-garde methodologies but proficient in their deployment amidst the exigencies of tangible situations.</p> <p>The instructional compendium entitled \"The Missing Course\" series acts as the cornerstone of our pedagogy, imparting a robust grounding in indispensable subject matter incorporating the arts of data manipulation, command line utilization, versioning of software revisions, debugging, system performance evaluation, and the arcane craft of metaprogramming. These sessions are tailored to forge connections between theoretical acumen and the pragmatic competencies demanded in the cybersecurity vocation.</p> <p>Our participation in illustrious tournaments such as the ASIS CTF Finals, IrisCTF, bi0sCTF, Insomni'hack, and Real World CTF will furnish our cadre with the prospect to gauge our prowess against some of the preeminent figures in this discipline. These rendezvous will afford us not simply the venue to employ our acquired enlightenment but also to assimilate wisdom from our contemporaries and perpetually refine our artifices.</p> <p>The institution of a monthly internal challenge, dubbed \"The Winter is Coming CTF,\" will maintain our ensemble's continued engagement and vigilance, thus preserving that the acquired skills are rigorously exercised and polished.</p> <p>Further, we have paved the way for the promulgation of knowledge and collaborative endeavor through the genesis of a GitHub consortium, devised for the synchronization of resources, which will act as a vault for our shared intellect and as an amphitheater for incessant edification.</p> <p>In essence, our envisioned timeline transcends a mere itinerary of forthcoming occurrences; it embodies a tactical blueprint, expressly contrived to inculcate a paradigm of superlative performance and an unyielding quest for proficiency in cybersecurity within our fraternity. As we advance upon this voyage, we persist malleable, amenable to embracing novel challenges and educational prospects that may present themselves. Our paramount ambition is to not only secure victory in competitive jousts but to sculpt a squadron supremely equipped to confront the cybersecurity menaces of the morrow. </p> <p>Let us proceed with tenacity and a collective ethos dedicated to pinnacle achievement, symbiotic coaction, and incessant melioration.

However, when decrypting, CKKS returns <code>m + e</code>, which just ... tells you ... what the secret error is.</p> <p>Basic algebra then gives <code>s = (c_1 - (m + e)) * c_0^{-1}</code>. Therefore, seeing a pair of encrypted and decrypted values is enough for a passive adversary to completely recover the secret key!</p> <p>However, this does seemingly require <code>c_0</code> to be invertible in the ring, which for our parameters is <code>Zmod(2^100)[x] / [x^1024]</code>.

This would force competitors to find another way to compute the required division. This appears to be supported by the linked paper (on page 18):</p> <p>A little difficulty arises due to the choice of q. The first implementation of CKKS, the HEAAN library sets q to a power of 2 to simplify the treatment of floating point numbers. Subsequent instantiations of CKKS use a prime (or square-free) q of the form h \u00b7 2^n + 1 together with the Number Theoretic Transform for very fast ring operations. For a (sufficiently large) prime q, the probability of a random element a being invertible is very close to 1, but this is not the case when q is a power of two. If a is not invertible, we can still recover partial information about the secret key s, and completely recover s by using multiple ciphertexts.</p> <p>My solution computes the inverse of <code>c_0</code> in the p-adic extension to R with 20480 digits of precision.

The goal is to determine that number is being added.</p> <p>The obfuscation comes from that all of the <code>Rz(theta)</code> rotations have been converted into long sequences of <code>H</code> and <code>T</code> gates -- thus making the entire quantum circuit only use <code>H, T, CNOT</code> gates. The program I used for this was gridsynth, which is much more efficient than other approaches, eg as given by the construction of the Solovay-Kitaev theorem.

The QFT consists of a long chain of CNOT gates and Rz rotations. The actual adder component consists of only Rz rotations, with no CNOT gates. So the longest chain of gates in the circuit which contains no CNOT gates is the adder. This is the only component which you need to statically analyze. You can determine this by reading about how the QFT works, or by looking at the generate.py script from last year's challenges.</p> <p>The following solution is essentially a quantum disassembler. For each single-qubit chain of H and T gates, it multiplies the gates together to determine what the quantum operator is.

To say that many health care professionals fall into these categories is not to fault them but merely to describe them. Who being young can know what it is like to be old? Who trained in western scientific medicine dares not try to be rational? Flag is life is fantastic.And who caught up in the task-oriented imperative of contemporary medicine can truly claim the virtue of patience? Even before managed-care initiatives so greatly increased the pressure, physicians were famously time-driven, trained to seek efficiency in all things, care of patients prominently among them. To such persons, the thought of reading a novel may seem a profligate waste of time. Why spend hours reading about what never happened? This question has been eloquently answered over the years by those who use literature in medical education. \n</code></pre>
